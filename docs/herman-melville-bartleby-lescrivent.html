                    <p>I am a rather elderly man. The nature of my avocations for the last
thirty years has brought me into more than ordinary contact with what
would seem an interesting and somewhat singular set of men, of whom as
yet nothing that I know of has ever been written:—I mean the
law-copyists or scriveners. I have known very many of them,
professionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate divers
histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental
souls might weep. But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners
for a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener of the
strangest I ever saw or heard of. While of other law-copyists I might
write the complete life, of Bartleby nothing of that sort can be done.
I believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography
of this man. It is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was one
of those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the
original sources, and in his case those are very small. What my own
astonished eyes saw of Bartleby, <em>that</em> is all I know of him, except,
indeed, one vague report which will appear in the sequel.</p>
<p>Ere introducing the scrivener, as he first appeared to me, it is fit I
make some mention of myself, my employés, my business, my chambers, and
general surroundings; because some such description is indispensable to
an adequate understanding of the chief character about to be presented.</p>
<p>Imprimis: I am a man who, from his youth upwards, has been filled with
a profound conviction that the easiest way of life is the best. Hence,
though I belong to a profession proverbially energetic and nervous,
even to turbulence, at times, yet nothing of that sort have I ever
suffered to invade my peace. I am one of those unambitious lawyers who
never addresses a jury, or in any way draws down public applause; but
in the cool tranquility of a snug retreat, do a snug business among
rich men’s bonds and mortgages and title-deeds. All who know me,
consider me an eminently <em>safe</em> man. The late John Jacob Astor, a
personage little given to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in
pronouncing my first grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I do
not speak it in vanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not
unemployed in my profession by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which,
I admit, I love to repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to
it, and rings like unto bullion. I will freely add, that I was not
insensible to the late John Jacob Astor’s good opinion.</p>
<p>Some time prior to the period at which this little history begins, my
avocations had been largely increased. The good old office, now extinct
in the State of New York, of a Master in Chancery, had been conferred
upon me. It was not a very arduous office, but very pleasantly
remunerative. I seldom lose my temper; much more seldom indulge in
dangerous indignation at wrongs and outrages; but I must be permitted
to be rash here and declare, that I consider the sudden and violent
abrogation of the office of Master in Chancery, by the new
Constitution, as a—premature act; inasmuch as I had counted upon a
life-lease of the profits, whereas I only received those of a few short
years. But this is by the way.</p>
<p>My chambers were up stairs at No.—Wall-street. At one end they looked
upon the white wall of the interior of a spacious sky-light shaft,
penetrating the building from top to bottom. This view might have been
considered rather tame than otherwise, deficient in what landscape
painters call “life.” But if so, the view from the other end of my
chambers offered, at least, a contrast, if nothing more. In that
direction my windows commanded an unobstructed view of a lofty brick
wall, black by age and everlasting shade; which wall required no
spy-glass to bring out its lurking beauties, but for the benefit of all
near-sighted spectators, was pushed up to within ten feet of my window
panes. Owing to the great height of the surrounding buildings, and my
chambers being on the second floor, the interval between this wall and
mine not a little resembled a huge square cistern.</p>
<p>At the period just preceding the advent of Bartleby, I had two persons
as copyists in my employment, and a promising lad as an office-boy.
First, Turkey; second, Nippers; third, Ginger Nut. These may seem
names, the like of which are not usually found in the Directory. In
truth they were nicknames, mutually conferred upon each other by my
three clerks, and were deemed expressive of their respective persons or
characters. Turkey was a short, pursy Englishman of about my own age,
that is, somewhere not far from sixty. In the morning, one might say,
his face was of a fine florid hue, but after twelve o’clock,
meridian—his dinner hour—it blazed like a grate full of Christmas
coals; and continued blazing—but, as it were, with a gradual wane—till
6 o’clock, P.M. or thereabouts, after which I saw no more of the
proprietor of the face, which gaining its meridian with the sun, seemed
to set with it, to rise, culminate, and decline the following day, with
the like regularity and undiminished glory. There are many singular
coincidences I have known in the course of my life, not the least among
which was the fact, that exactly when Turkey displayed his fullest
beams from his red and radiant countenance, just then, too, at that
critical moment, began the daily period when I considered his business
capacities as seriously disturbed for the remainder of the twenty-four
hours. Not that he was absolutely idle, or averse to business then; far
from it. The difficulty was, he was apt to be altogether too energetic.
There was a strange, inflamed, flurried, flighty recklessness of
activity about him. He would be incautious in dipping his pen into his
inkstand. All his blots upon my documents, were dropped there after
twelve o’clock, meridian. Indeed, not only would he be reckless and
sadly given to making blots in the afternoon, but some days he went
further, and was rather noisy. At such times, too, his face flamed with
augmented blazonry, as if cannel coal had been heaped on anthracite. He
made an unpleasant racket with his chair; spilled his sand-box; in
mending his pens, impatiently split them all to pieces, and threw them
on the floor in a sudden passion; stood up and leaned over his table,
boxing his papers about in a most indecorous manner, very sad to behold
in an elderly man like him. Nevertheless, as he was in many ways a most
valuable person to me, and all the time before twelve o’clock,
meridian, was the quickest, steadiest creature too, accomplishing a
great deal of work in a style not easy to be matched—for these reasons,
I was willing to overlook his eccentricities, though indeed,
occasionally, I remonstrated with him. I did this very gently, however,
because, though the civilest, nay, the blandest and most reverential of
men in the morning, yet in the afternoon he was disposed, upon
provocation, to be slightly rash with his tongue, in fact, insolent.
Now, valuing his morning services as I did, and resolved not to lose
them; yet, at the same time made uncomfortable by his inflamed ways
after twelve o’clock; and being a man of peace, unwilling by my
admonitions to call forth unseemly retorts from him; I took upon me,
one Saturday noon (he was always worse on Saturdays), to hint to him,
very kindly, that perhaps now that he was growing old, it might be well
to abridge his labors; in short, he need not come to my chambers after
twelve o’clock, but, dinner over, had best go home to his lodgings and
rest himself till teatime. But no; he insisted upon his afternoon
devotions. His countenance became intolerably fervid, as he
oratorically assured me—gesticulating with a long ruler at the other
end of the room—that if his services in the morning were useful, how
indispensable, then, in the afternoon?</p>
<p>“With submission, sir,” said Turkey on this occasion, “I consider
myself your right-hand man. In the morning I but marshal and deploy my
columns; but in the afternoon I put myself at their head, and gallantly
charge the foe, thus!”—and he made a violent thrust with the ruler.</p>
<p>“But the blots, Turkey,” intimated I.</p>
<p>“True,—but, with submission, sir, behold these hairs! I am getting old.
Surely, sir, a blot or two of a warm afternoon is not to be severely
urged against gray hairs. Old age—even if it blot the page—is
honorable. With submission, sir, we <em>both</em> are getting old.”</p>
<p>This appeal to my fellow-feeling was hardly to be resisted. At all
events, I saw that go he would not. So I made up my mind to let him
stay, resolving, nevertheless, to see to it, that during the afternoon
he had to do with my less important papers.</p>
<p>Nippers, the second on my list, was a whiskered, sallow, and, upon the
whole, rather piratical-looking young man of about five and twenty. I
always deemed him the victim of two evil powers—ambition and
indigestion. The ambition was evinced by a certain impatience of the
duties of a mere copyist, an unwarrantable usurpation of strictly
professional affairs, such as the original drawing up of legal
documents. The indigestion seemed betokened in an occasional nervous
testiness and grinning irritability, causing the teeth to audibly grind
together over mistakes committed in copying; unnecessary maledictions,
hissed, rather than spoken, in the heat of business; and especially by
a continual discontent with the height of the table where he worked.
Though of a very ingenious mechanical turn, Nippers could never get
this table to suit him. He put chips under it, blocks of various sorts,
bits of pasteboard, and at last went so far as to attempt an exquisite
adjustment by final pieces of folded blotting paper. But no invention
would answer. If, for the sake of easing his back, he brought the table
lid at a sharp angle well up towards his chin, and wrote there like a
man using the steep roof of a Dutch house for his desk:—then he
declared that it stopped the circulation in his arms. If now he lowered
the table to his waistbands, and stooped over it in writing, then there
was a sore aching in his back. In short, the truth of the matter was,
Nippers knew not what he wanted. Or, if he wanted any thing, it was to
be rid of a scrivener’s table altogether. Among the manifestations of
his diseased ambition was a fondness he had for receiving visits from
certain ambiguous-looking fellows in seedy coats, whom he called his
clients. Indeed I was aware that not only was he, at times,
considerable of a ward-politician, but he occasionally did a little
business at the Justices’ courts, and was not unknown on the steps of
the Tombs. I have good reason to believe, however, that one individual
who called upon him at my chambers, and who, with a grand air, he
insisted was his client, was no other than a dun, and the alleged
title-deed, a bill. But with all his failings, and the annoyances he
caused me, Nippers, like his compatriot Turkey, was a very useful man
to me; wrote a neat, swift hand; and, when he chose, was not deficient
in a gentlemanly sort of deportment. Added to this, he always dressed
in a gentlemanly sort of way; and so, incidentally, reflected credit
upon my chambers. Whereas with respect to Turkey, I had much ado to
keep him from being a reproach to me. His clothes were apt to look oily
and smell of eating-houses. He wore his pantaloons very loose and baggy
in summer. His coats were execrable; his hat not to be handled. But
while the hat was a thing of indifference to me, inasmuch as his
natural civility and deference, as a dependent Englishman, always led
him to doff it the moment he entered the room, yet his coat was another
matter. Concerning his coats, I reasoned with him; but with no effect.
The truth was, I suppose, that a man of so small an income, could not
afford to sport such a lustrous face and a lustrous coat at one and the
same time. As Nippers once observed, Turkey’s money went chiefly for
red ink. One winter day I presented Turkey with a highly-respectable
looking coat of my own, a padded gray coat, of a most comfortable
warmth, and which buttoned straight up from the knee to the neck. I
thought Turkey would appreciate the favor, and abate his rashness and
obstreperousness of afternoons. But no. I verily believe that buttoning
himself up in so downy and blanket-like a coat had a pernicious effect
upon him; upon the same principle that too much oats are bad for
horses. In fact, precisely as a rash, restive horse is said to feel his
oats, so Turkey felt his coat. It made him insolent. He was a man whom
prosperity harmed.</p>
<p>Though concerning the self-indulgent habits of Turkey I had my own
private surmises, yet touching Nippers I was well persuaded that
whatever might be his faults in other respects, he was, at least, a
temperate young man. But indeed, nature herself seemed to have been his
vintner, and at his birth charged him so thoroughly with an irritable,
brandy-like disposition, that all subsequent potations were needless.
When I consider how, amid the stillness of my chambers, Nippers would
sometimes impatiently rise from his seat, and stooping over his table,
spread his arms wide apart, seize the whole desk, and move it, and jerk
it, with a grim, grinding motion on the floor, as if the table were a
perverse voluntary agent, intent on thwarting and vexing him; I plainly
perceive that for Nippers, brandy and water were altogether
superfluous.</p>
<p>It was fortunate for me that, owing to its peculiar
cause—indigestion—the irritability and consequent nervousness of
Nippers, were mainly observable in the morning, while in the afternoon
he was comparatively mild. So that Turkey’s paroxysms only coming on
about twelve o’clock, I never had to do with their eccentricities at
one time. Their fits relieved each other like guards. When Nippers’ was
on, Turkey’s was off; and <em>vice versa</em>. This was a good natural
arrangement under the circumstances.</p>
<p>Ginger Nut, the third on my list, was a lad some twelve years old. His
father was a carman, ambitious of seeing his son on the bench instead
of a cart, before he died. So he sent him to my office as student at
law, errand boy, and cleaner and sweeper, at the rate of one dollar a
week. He had a little desk to himself, but he did not use it much. Upon
inspection, the drawer exhibited a great array of the shells of various
sorts of nuts. Indeed, to this quick-witted youth the whole noble
science of the law was contained in a nut-shell. Not the least among
the employments of Ginger Nut, as well as one which he discharged with
the most alacrity, was his duty as cake and apple purveyor for Turkey
and Nippers. Copying law papers being proverbially dry, husky sort of
business, my two scriveners were fain to moisten their mouths very
often with Spitzenbergs to be had at the numerous stalls nigh the
Custom House and Post Office. Also, they sent Ginger Nut very
frequently for that peculiar cake—small, flat, round, and very
spicy—after which he had been named by them. Of a cold morning when
business was but dull, Turkey would gobble up scores of these cakes, as
if they were mere wafers—indeed they sell them at the rate of six or
eight for a penny—the scrape of his pen blending with the crunching of
the crisp particles in his mouth. Of all the fiery afternoon blunders
and flurried rashnesses of Turkey, was his once moistening a
ginger-cake between his lips, and clapping it on to a mortgage for a
seal. I came within an ace of dismissing him then. But he mollified me
by making an oriental bow, and saying—“With submission, sir, it was
generous of me to find you in stationery on my own account.”</p>
<p>Now my original business—that of a conveyancer and title hunter, and
drawer-up of recondite documents of all sorts—was considerably
increased by receiving the master’s office. There was now great work
for scriveners. Not only must I push the clerks already with me, but I
must have additional help. In answer to my advertisement, a motionless
young man one morning, stood upon my office threshold, the door being
open, for it was summer. I can see that figure now—pallidly neat,
pitiably respectable, incurably forlorn! It was Bartleby.</p>
<p>After a few words touching his qualifications, I engaged him, glad to
have among my corps of copyists a man of so singularly sedate an
aspect, which I thought might operate beneficially upon the flighty
temper of Turkey, and the fiery one of Nippers.</p>
<p>I should have stated before that ground glass folding-doors divided my
premises into two parts, one of which was occupied by my scriveners,
the other by myself. According to my humor I threw open these doors, or
closed them. I resolved to assign Bartleby a corner by the
folding-doors, but on my side of them, so as to have this quiet man
within easy call, in case any trifling thing was to be done. I placed
his desk close up to a small side-window in that part of the room, a
window which originally had afforded a lateral view of certain grimy
back-yards and bricks, but which, owing to subsequent erections,
commanded at present no view at all, though it gave some light. Within
three feet of the panes was a wall, and the light came down from far
above, between two lofty buildings, as from a very small opening in a
dome. Still further to a satisfactory arrangement, I procured a high
green folding screen, which might entirely isolate Bartleby from my
sight, though not remove him from my voice. And thus, in a manner,
privacy and society were conjoined.</p>
<p>At first Bartleby did an extraordinary quantity of writing. As if long
famishing for something to copy, he seemed to gorge himself on my
documents. There was no pause for digestion. He ran a day and night
line, copying by sun-light and by candle-light. I should have been
quite delighted with his application, had he been cheerfully
industrious. But he wrote on silently, palely, mechanically.</p>
<p>It is, of course, an indispensable part of a scrivener’s business to
verify the accuracy of his copy, word by word. Where there are two or
more scriveners in an office, they assist each other in this
examination, one reading from the copy, the other holding the original.
It is a very dull, wearisome, and lethargic affair. I can readily
imagine that to some sanguine temperaments it would be altogether
intolerable. For example, I cannot credit that the mettlesome poet
Byron would have contentedly sat down with Bartleby to examine a law
document of, say five hundred pages, closely written in a crimpy hand.</p>
<p>Now and then, in the haste of business, it had been my habit to assist
in comparing some brief document myself, calling Turkey or Nippers for
this purpose. One object I had in placing Bartleby so handy to me
behind the screen, was to avail myself of his services on such trivial
occasions. It was on the third day, I think, of his being with me, and
before any necessity had arisen for having his own writing examined,
that, being much hurried to complete a small affair I had in hand, I
abruptly called to Bartleby. In my haste and natural expectancy of
instant compliance, I sat with my head bent over the original on my
desk, and my right hand sideways, and somewhat nervously extended with
the copy, so that immediately upon emerging from his retreat, Bartleby
might snatch it and proceed to business without the least delay.</p>
<p>In this very attitude did I sit when I called to him, rapidly stating
what it was I wanted him to do—namely, to examine a small paper with
me. Imagine my surprise, nay, my consternation, when without moving
from his privacy, Bartleby in a singularly mild, firm voice, replied,
“I would prefer not to.”</p>
<p>I sat awhile in perfect silence, rallying my stunned faculties.
Immediately it occurred to me that my ears had deceived me, or Bartleby
had entirely misunderstood my meaning. I repeated my request in the
clearest tone I could assume. But in quite as clear a one came the
previous reply, “I would prefer not to.”</p>
<p>“Prefer not to,” echoed I, rising in high excitement, and crossing the
room with a stride. “What do you mean? Are you moon-struck? I want you
to help me compare this sheet here—take it,” and I thrust it towards
him.</p>
<p>“I would prefer not to,” said he.</p>
<p>I looked at him steadfastly. His face was leanly composed; his gray eye
dimly calm. Not a wrinkle of agitation rippled him. Had there been the
least uneasiness, anger, impatience or impertinence in his manner; in
other words, had there been any thing ordinarily human about him,
doubtless I should have violently dismissed him from the premises. But
as it was, I should have as soon thought of turning my pale
plaster-of-paris bust of Cicero out of doors. I stood gazing at him
awhile, as he went on with his own writing, and then reseated myself at
my desk. This is very strange, thought I. What had one best do? But my
business hurried me. I concluded to forget the matter for the present,
reserving it for my future leisure. So calling Nippers from the other
room, the paper was speedily examined.</p>
<p>A few days after this, Bartleby concluded four lengthy documents, being
quadruplicates of a week’s testimony taken before me in my High Court
of Chancery. It became necessary to examine them. It was an important
suit, and great accuracy was imperative. Having all things arranged I
called Turkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut from the next room, meaning to
place the four copies in the hands of my four clerks, while I should
read from the original. Accordingly Turkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut had
taken their seats in a row, each with his document in hand, when I
called to Bartleby to join this interesting group.</p>
<p>“Bartleby! quick, I am waiting.”</p>
<p>I heard a slow scrape of his chair legs on the uncarpeted floor, and
soon he appeared standing at the entrance of his hermitage.</p>
<p>“What is wanted?” said he mildly.</p>
<p>“The copies, the copies,” said I hurriedly. “We are going to examine
them. There”—and I held towards him the fourth quadruplicate.</p>
<p>“I would prefer not to,” he said, and gently disappeared behind the
screen.</p>
<p>For a few moments I was turned into a pillar of salt, standing at the
head of my seated column of clerks. Recovering myself, I advanced
towards the screen, and demanded the reason for such extraordinary
conduct.</p>
<p>“<em>Why</em> do you refuse?”</p>
<p>“I would prefer not to.”</p>
<p>With any other man I should have flown outright into a dreadful
passion, scorned all further words, and thrust him ignominiously from
my presence. But there was something about Bartleby that not only
strangely disarmed me, but in a wonderful manner touched and
disconcerted me. I began to reason with him.</p>
<p>“These are your own copies we are about to examine. It is labor saving
to you, because one examination will answer for your four papers. It is
common usage. Every copyist is bound to help examine his copy. Is it
not so? Will you not speak? Answer!”</p>
<p>“I prefer not to,” he replied in a flute-like tone. It seemed to me
that while I had been addressing him, he carefully revolved every
statement that I made; fully comprehended the meaning; could not
gainsay the irresistible conclusions; but, at the same time, some
paramount consideration prevailed with him to reply as he did.</p>
<p>“You are decided, then, not to comply with my request—a request made
according to common usage and common sense?”</p>
<p>He briefly gave me to understand that on that point my judgment was
sound. Yes: his decision was irreversible.</p>
<p>It is not seldom the case that when a man is browbeaten in some
unprecedented and violently unreasonable way, he begins to stagger in
his own plainest faith. He begins, as it were, vaguely to surmise that,
wonderful as it may be, all the justice and all the reason is on the
other side. Accordingly, if any disinterested persons are present, he
turns to them for some reinforcement for his own faltering mind.</p>
<p>“Turkey,” said I, “what do you think of this? Am I not right?”</p>
<p>“With submission, sir,” said Turkey, with his blandest tone, “I think
that you are.”</p>
<p>“Nippers,” said I, “what do <em>you</em> think of it?”</p>
<p>“I think I should kick him out of the office.”</p>
<p>(The reader of nice perceptions will here perceive that, it being
morning, Turkey’s answer is couched in polite and tranquil terms, but
Nippers replies in ill-tempered ones. Or, to repeat a previous
sentence, Nippers’ ugly mood was on duty and Turkey’s off.)</p>
<p>“Ginger Nut,” said I, willing to enlist the smallest suffrage in my
behalf, “what do you think of it?”</p>
<p>“I think, sir, he’s a little <em>luny</em>,” replied Ginger Nut with a grin.</p>
<p>“You hear what they say,” said I, turning towards the screen, “come
forth and do your duty.”</p>
<p>But he vouchsafed no reply. I pondered a moment in sore perplexity. But
once more business hurried me. I determined again to postpone the
consideration of this dilemma to my future leisure. With a little
trouble we made out to examine the papers without Bartleby, though at
every page or two, Turkey deferentially dropped his opinion that this
proceeding was quite out of the common; while Nippers, twitching in his
chair with a dyspeptic nervousness, ground out between his set teeth
occasional hissing maledictions against the stubborn oaf behind the
screen. And for his (Nippers’) part, this was the first and the last
time he would do another man’s business without pay.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Bartleby sat in his hermitage, oblivious to every thing but
his own peculiar business there.</p>
<p>Some days passed, the scrivener being employed upon another lengthy
work. His late remarkable conduct led me to regard his ways narrowly. I
observed that he never went to dinner; indeed that he never went any
where. As yet I had never of my personal knowledge known him to be
outside of my office. He was a perpetual sentry in the corner. At about
eleven o’clock though, in the morning, I noticed that Ginger Nut would
advance toward the opening in Bartleby’s screen, as if silently
beckoned thither by a gesture invisible to me where I sat. The boy
would then leave the office jingling a few pence, and reappear with a
handful of ginger-nuts which he delivered in the hermitage, receiving
two of the cakes for his trouble.</p>
<p>He lives, then, on ginger-nuts, thought I; never eats a dinner,
properly speaking; he must be a vegetarian then; but no; he never eats
even vegetables, he eats nothing but ginger-nuts. My mind then ran on
in reveries concerning the probable effects upon the human constitution
of living entirely on ginger-nuts. Ginger-nuts are so called because
they contain ginger as one of their peculiar constituents, and the
final flavoring one. Now what was ginger? A hot, spicy thing. Was
Bartleby hot and spicy? Not at all. Ginger, then, had no effect upon
Bartleby. Probably he preferred it should have none.</p>
<p>Nothing so aggravates an earnest person as a passive resistance. If the
individual so resisted be of a not inhumane temper, and the resisting
one perfectly harmless in his passivity; then, in the better moods of
the former, he will endeavor charitably to construe to his imagination
what proves impossible to be solved by his judgment. Even so, for the
most part, I regarded Bartleby and his ways. Poor fellow! thought I, he
means no mischief; it is plain he intends no insolence; his aspect
sufficiently evinces that his eccentricities are involuntary. He is
useful to me. I can get along with him. If I turn him away, the chances
are he will fall in with some less indulgent employer, and then he will
be rudely treated, and perhaps driven forth miserably to starve. Yes.
Here I can cheaply purchase a delicious self-approval. To befriend
Bartleby; to humor him in his strange willfulness, will cost me little
or nothing, while I lay up in my soul what will eventually prove a
sweet morsel for my conscience. But this mood was not invariable with
me. The passiveness of Bartleby sometimes irritated me. I felt
strangely goaded on to encounter him in new opposition, to elicit some
angry spark from him answerable to my own. But indeed I might as well
have essayed to strike fire with my knuckles against a bit of Windsor
soap. But one afternoon the evil impulse in me mastered me, and the
following little scene ensued:</p>
<p>“Bartleby,” said I, “when those papers are all copied, I will compare
them with you.”</p>
<p>“I would prefer not to.”</p>
<p>“How? Surely you do not mean to persist in that mulish vagary?”</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>I threw open the folding-doors near by, and turning upon Turkey and
Nippers, exclaimed in an excited manner—</p>
<p>“He says, a second time, he won’t examine his papers. What do you think
of it, Turkey?”</p>
<p>It was afternoon, be it remembered. Turkey sat glowing like a brass
boiler, his bald head steaming, his hands reeling among his blotted
papers.</p>
<p>“Think of it?” roared Turkey; “I think I’ll just step behind his
screen, and black his eyes for him!”</p>
<p>So saying, Turkey rose to his feet and threw his arms into a pugilistic
position. He was hurrying away to make good his promise, when I
detained him, alarmed at the effect of incautiously rousing Turkey’s
combativeness after dinner.</p>
<p>“Sit down, Turkey,” said I, “and hear what Nippers has to say. What do
you think of it, Nippers? Would I not be justified in immediately
dismissing Bartleby?”</p>
<p>“Excuse me, that is for you to decide, sir. I think his conduct quite
unusual, and indeed unjust, as regards Turkey and myself. But it may
only be a passing whim.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” exclaimed I, “you have strangely changed your mind then—you speak
very gently of him now.”</p>
<p>“All beer,” cried Turkey; “gentleness is effects of beer—Nippers and I
dined together to-day. You see how gentle <em>I</em> am, sir. Shall I go and
black his eyes?”</p>
<p>“You refer to Bartleby, I suppose. No, not to-day, Turkey,” I replied;
“pray, put up your fists.”</p>
<p>I closed the doors, and again advanced towards Bartleby. I felt
additional incentives tempting me to my fate. I burned to be rebelled
against again. I remembered that Bartleby never left the office.</p>
<p>“Bartleby,” said I, “Ginger Nut is away; just step round to the Post
Office, won’t you? (it was but a three minute walk,) and see if there
is any thing for me.”</p>
<p>“I would prefer not to.”</p>
<p>“You <em>will</em> not?”</p>
<p>“I <em>prefer</em> not.”</p>
<p>I staggered to my desk, and sat there in a deep study. My blind
inveteracy returned. Was there any other thing in which I could procure
myself to be ignominiously repulsed by this lean, penniless wight?—my
hired clerk? What added thing is there, perfectly reasonable, that he
will be sure to refuse to do?</p>
<p>“Bartleby!”</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>“Bartleby,” in a louder tone.</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>“Bartleby,” I roared.</p>
<p>Like a very ghost, agreeably to the laws of magical invocation, at the
third summons, he appeared at the entrance of his hermitage.</p>
<p>“Go to the next room, and tell Nippers to come to me.”</p>
<p>“I prefer not to,” he respectfully and slowly said, and mildly
disappeared.</p>
<p>“Very good, Bartleby,” said I, in a quiet sort of serenely severe
self-possessed tone, intimating the unalterable purpose of some
terrible retribution very close at hand. At the moment I half intended
something of the kind. But upon the whole, as it was drawing towards my
dinner-hour, I thought it best to put on my hat and walk home for the
day, suffering much from perplexity and distress of mind.</p>
<p>Shall I acknowledge it? The conclusion of this whole business was, that
it soon became a fixed fact of my chambers, that a pale young
scrivener, by the name of Bartleby, and a desk there; that he copied
for me at the usual rate of four cents a folio (one hundred words); but
he was permanently exempt from examining the work done by him, that
duty being transferred to Turkey and Nippers, one of compliment
doubtless to their superior acuteness; moreover, said Bartleby was
never on any account to be dispatched on the most trivial errand of any
sort; and that even if entreated to take upon him such a matter, it was
generally understood that he would prefer not to—in other words, that
he would refuse pointblank.</p>
<p>As days passed on, I became considerably reconciled to Bartleby. His
steadiness, his freedom from all dissipation, his incessant industry
(except when he chose to throw himself into a standing revery behind
his screen), his great stillness, his unalterableness of demeanor under
all circumstances, made him a valuable acquisition. One prime thing was
this,—<em>he was always there;</em>—first in the morning, continually through
the day, and the last at night. I had a singular confidence in his
honesty. I felt my most precious papers perfectly safe in his hands.
Sometimes to be sure I could not, for the very soul of me, avoid
falling into sudden spasmodic passions with him. For it was exceeding
difficult to bear in mind all the time those strange peculiarities,
privileges, and unheard of exemptions, forming the tacit stipulations
on Bartleby’s part under which he remained in my office. Now and then,
in the eagerness of dispatching pressing business, I would
inadvertently summon Bartleby, in a short, rapid tone, to put his
finger, say, on the incipient tie of a bit of red tape with which I was
about compressing some papers. Of course, from behind the screen the
usual answer, “I prefer not to,” was sure to come; and then, how could
a human creature with the common infirmities of our nature, refrain
from bitterly exclaiming upon such perverseness—such unreasonableness.
However, every added repulse of this sort which I received only tended
to lessen the probability of my repeating the inadvertence.</p>
<p>Here it must be said, that according to the custom of most legal
gentlemen occupying chambers in densely-populated law buildings, there
were several keys to my door. One was kept by a woman residing in the
attic, which person weekly scrubbed and daily swept and dusted my
apartments. Another was kept by Turkey for convenience sake. The third
I sometimes carried in my own pocket. The fourth I knew not who had.</p>
<p>Now, one Sunday morning I happened to go to Trinity Church, to hear a
celebrated preacher, and finding myself rather early on the ground, I
thought I would walk around to my chambers for a while. Luckily I had
my key with me; but upon applying it to the lock, I found it resisted
by something inserted from the inside. Quite surprised, I called out;
when to my consternation a key was turned from within; and thrusting
his lean visage at me, and holding the door ajar, the apparition of
Bartleby appeared, in his shirt sleeves, and otherwise in a strangely
tattered dishabille, saying quietly that he was sorry, but he was
deeply engaged just then, and—preferred not admitting me at present. In
a brief word or two, he moreover added, that perhaps I had better walk
round the block two or three times, and by that time he would probably
have concluded his affairs.</p>
<p>Now, the utterly unsurmised appearance of Bartleby, tenanting my
law-chambers of a Sunday morning, with his cadaverously gentlemanly
<em>nonchalance</em>, yet withal firm and self-possessed, had such a strange
effect upon me, that incontinently I slunk away from my own door, and
did as desired. But not without sundry twinges of impotent rebellion
against the mild effrontery of this unaccountable scrivener. Indeed, it
was his wonderful mildness chiefly, which not only disarmed me, but
unmanned me, as it were. For I consider that one, for the time, is a
sort of unmanned when he tranquilly permits his hired clerk to dictate
to him, and order him away from his own premises. Furthermore, I was
full of uneasiness as to what Bartleby could possibly be doing in my
office in his shirt sleeves, and in an otherwise dismantled condition
of a Sunday morning. Was any thing amiss going on? Nay, that was out of
the question. It was not to be thought of for a moment that Bartleby
was an immoral person. But what could he be doing there?—copying? Nay
again, whatever might be his eccentricities, Bartleby was an eminently
decorous person. He would be the last man to sit down to his desk in
any state approaching to nudity. Besides, it was Sunday; and there was
something about Bartleby that forbade the supposition that he would by
any secular occupation violate the proprieties of the day.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, my mind was not pacified; and full of a restless
curiosity, at last I returned to the door. Without hindrance I inserted
my key, opened it, and entered. Bartleby was not to be seen. I looked
round anxiously, peeped behind his screen; but it was very plain that
he was gone. Upon more closely examining the place, I surmised that for
an indefinite period Bartleby must have ate, dressed, and slept in my
office, and that too without plate, mirror, or bed. The cushioned seat
of a rickety old sofa in one corner bore the faint impress of a lean,
reclining form. Rolled away under his desk, I found a blanket; under
the empty grate, a blacking box and brush; on a chair, a tin basin,
with soap and a ragged towel; in a newspaper a few crumbs of
ginger-nuts and a morsel of cheese. Yes, thought I, it is evident
enough that Bartleby has been making his home here, keeping bachelor’s
hall all by himself. Immediately then the thought came sweeping across
me, What miserable friendlessness and loneliness are here revealed! His
poverty is great; but his solitude, how horrible! Think of it. Of a
Sunday, Wall-street is deserted as Petra; and every night of every day
it is an emptiness. This building too, which of week-days hums with
industry and life, at nightfall echoes with sheer vacancy, and all
through Sunday is forlorn. And here Bartleby makes his home; sole
spectator of a solitude which he has seen all populous—a sort of
innocent and transformed Marius brooding among the ruins of Carthage!</p>
<p>For the first time in my life a feeling of overpowering stinging
melancholy seized me. Before, I had never experienced aught but a
not-unpleasing sadness. The bond of a common humanity now drew me
irresistibly to gloom. A fraternal melancholy! For both I and Bartleby
were sons of Adam. I remembered the bright silks and sparkling faces I
had seen that day, in gala trim, swan-like sailing down the Mississippi
of Broadway; and I contrasted them with the pallid copyist, and thought
to myself, Ah, happiness courts the light, so we deem the world is gay;
but misery hides aloof, so we deem that misery there is none. These sad
fancyings—chimeras, doubtless, of a sick and silly brain—led on to
other and more special thoughts, concerning the eccentricities of
Bartleby. Presentiments of strange discoveries hovered round me. The
scrivener’s pale form appeared to me laid out, among uncaring
strangers, in its shivering winding sheet.</p>
<p>Suddenly I was attracted by Bartleby’s closed desk, the key in open
sight left in the lock.</p>
<p>I mean no mischief, seek the gratification of no heartless curiosity,
thought I; besides, the desk is mine, and its contents too, so I will
make bold to look within. Every thing was methodically arranged, the
papers smoothly placed. The pigeon holes were deep, and removing the
files of documents, I groped into their recesses. Presently I felt
something there, and dragged it out. It was an old bandanna
handkerchief, heavy and knotted. I opened it, and saw it was a savings’
bank.</p>
<p>I now recalled all the quiet mysteries which I had noted in the man. I
remembered that he never spoke but to answer; that though at intervals
he had considerable time to himself, yet I had never seen him
reading—no, not even a newspaper; that for long periods he would stand
looking out, at his pale window behind the screen, upon the dead brick
wall; I was quite sure he never visited any refectory or eating house;
while his pale face clearly indicated that he never drank beer like
Turkey, or tea and coffee even, like other men; that he never went any
where in particular that I could learn; never went out for a walk,
unless indeed that was the case at present; that he had declined
telling who he was, or whence he came, or whether he had any relatives
in the world; that though so thin and pale, he never complained of ill
health. And more than all, I remembered a certain unconscious air of
pallid—how shall I call it?—of pallid haughtiness, say, or rather an
austere reserve about him, which had positively awed me into my tame
compliance with his eccentricities, when I had feared to ask him to do
the slightest incidental thing for me, even though I might know, from
his long-continued motionlessness, that behind his screen he must be
standing in one of those dead-wall reveries of his.</p>
<p>Revolving all these things, and coupling them with the recently
discovered fact that he made my office his constant abiding place and
home, and not forgetful of his morbid moodiness; revolving all these
things, a prudential feeling began to steal over me. My first emotions
had been those of pure melancholy and sincerest pity; but just in
proportion as the forlornness of Bartleby grew and grew to my
imagination, did that same melancholy merge into fear, that pity into
repulsion. So true it is, and so terrible too, that up to a certain
point the thought or sight of misery enlists our best affections; but,
in certain special cases, beyond that point it does not. They err who
would assert that invariably this is owing to the inherent selfishness
of the human heart. It rather proceeds from a certain hopelessness of
remedying excessive and organic ill. To a sensitive being, pity is not
seldom pain. And when at last it is perceived that such pity cannot
lead to effectual succor, common sense bids the soul rid of it. What I
saw that morning persuaded me that the scrivener was the victim of
innate and incurable disorder. I might give alms to his body; but his
body did not pain him; it was his soul that suffered, and his soul I
could not reach.</p>
<p>I did not accomplish the purpose of going to Trinity Church that
morning. Somehow, the things I had seen disqualified me for the time
from church-going. I walked homeward, thinking what I would do with
Bartleby. Finally, I resolved upon this;—I would put certain calm
questions to him the next morning, touching his history, etc., and if
he declined to answer them openly and unreservedly (and I supposed he
would prefer not), then to give him a twenty dollar bill over and above
whatever I might owe him, and tell him his services were no longer
required; but that if in any other way I could assist him, I would be
happy to do so, especially if he desired to return to his native place,
wherever that might be, I would willingly help to defray the expenses.
Moreover, if, after reaching home, he found himself at any time in want
of aid, a letter from him would be sure of a reply.</p>
<p>The next morning came.</p>
<p>“Bartleby,” said I, gently calling to him behind his screen.</p>
<p>No reply.</p>
<p>“Bartleby,” said I, in a still gentler tone, “come here; I am not going
to ask you to do any thing you would prefer not to do—I simply wish to
speak to you.”</p>
<p>Upon this he noiselessly slid into view.</p>
<p>“Will you tell me, Bartleby, where you were born?”</p>
<p>“I would prefer not to.”</p>
<p>“Will you tell me <em>any thing</em> about yourself?”</p>
<p>“I would prefer not to.”</p>
<p>“But what reasonable objection can you have to speak to me? I feel
friendly towards you.”</p>
<p>He did not look at me while I spoke, but kept his glance fixed upon my
bust of Cicero, which as I then sat, was directly behind me, some six
inches above my head.</p>
<p>“What is your answer, Bartleby?” said I, after waiting a considerable
time for a reply, during which his countenance remained immovable, only
there was the faintest conceivable tremor of the white attenuated
mouth.</p>
<p>“At present I prefer to give no answer,” he said, and retired into his
hermitage.</p>
<p>It was rather weak in me I confess, but his manner on this occasion
nettled me. Not only did there seem to lurk in it a certain calm
disdain, but his perverseness seemed ungrateful, considering the
undeniable good usage and indulgence he had received from me.</p>
<p>Again I sat ruminating what I should do. Mortified as I was at his
behavior, and resolved as I had been to dismiss him when I entered my
offices, nevertheless I strangely felt something superstitious knocking
at my heart, and forbidding me to carry out my purpose, and denouncing
me for a villain if I dared to breathe one bitter word against this
forlornest of mankind. At last, familiarly drawing my chair behind his
screen, I sat down and said: “Bartleby, never mind then about revealing
your history; but let me entreat you, as a friend, to comply as far as
may be with the usages of this office. Say now you will help to examine
papers to-morrow or next day: in short, say now that in a day or two
you will begin to be a little reasonable:—say so, Bartleby.”</p>
<p>“At present I would prefer not to be a little reasonable,” was his
mildly cadaverous reply.</p>
<p>Just then the folding-doors opened, and Nippers approached. He seemed
suffering from an unusually bad night’s rest, induced by severer
indigestion than common. He overheard those final words of Bartleby.</p>
<p>“<em>Prefer not</em>, eh?” gritted Nippers—“I’d <em>prefer</em> him, if I were you,
sir,” addressing me—“I’d <em>prefer</em> him; I’d give him preferences, the
stubborn mule! What is it, sir, pray, that he <em>prefers</em> not to do now?”</p>
<p>Bartleby moved not a limb.</p>
<p>“Mr. Nippers,” said I, “I’d prefer that you would withdraw for the
present.”</p>
<p>Somehow, of late I had got into the way of involuntarily using this
word “prefer” upon all sorts of not exactly suitable occasions. And I
trembled to think that my contact with the scrivener had already and
seriously affected me in a mental way. And what further and deeper
aberration might it not yet produce? This apprehension had not been
without efficacy in determining me to summary means.</p>
<p>As Nippers, looking very sour and sulky, was departing, Turkey blandly
and deferentially approached.</p>
<p>“With submission, sir,” said he, “yesterday I was thinking about
Bartleby here, and I think that if he would but prefer to take a quart
of good ale every day, it would do much towards mending him, and
enabling him to assist in examining his papers.”</p>
<p>“So you have got the word too,” said I, slightly excited.</p>
<p>“With submission, what word, sir,” asked Turkey, respectfully crowding
himself into the contracted space behind the screen, and by so doing,
making me jostle the scrivener. “What word, sir?”</p>
<p>“I would prefer to be left alone here,” said Bartleby, as if offended
at being mobbed in his privacy.</p>
<p>“<em>That’s</em> the word, Turkey,” said I—“that’s it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, <em>prefer</em>? oh yes—queer word. I never use it myself. But, sir, as I
was saying, if he would but prefer—”</p>
<p>“Turkey,” interrupted I, “you will please withdraw.”</p>
<p>“Oh certainly, sir, if you prefer that I should.”</p>
<p>As he opened the folding-door to retire, Nippers at his desk caught a
glimpse of me, and asked whether I would prefer to have a certain paper
copied on blue paper or white. He did not in the least roguishly accent
the word prefer. It was plain that it involuntarily rolled from his
tongue. I thought to myself, surely I must get rid of a demented man,
who already has in some degree turned the tongues, if not the heads of
myself and clerks. But I thought it prudent not to break the dismission
at once.</p>
<p>The next day I noticed that Bartleby did nothing but stand at his
window in his dead-wall revery. Upon asking him why he did not write,
he said that he had decided upon doing no more writing.</p>
<p>“Why, how now? what next?” exclaimed I, “do no more writing?”</p>
<p>“No more.”</p>
<p>“And what is the reason?”</p>
<p>“Do you not see the reason for yourself,” he indifferently replied.</p>
<p>I looked steadfastly at him, and perceived that his eyes looked dull
and glazed. Instantly it occurred to me, that his unexampled diligence
in copying by his dim window for the first few weeks of his stay with
me might have temporarily impaired his vision.</p>
<p>I was touched. I said something in condolence with him. I hinted that
of course he did wisely in abstaining from writing for a while; and
urged him to embrace that opportunity of taking wholesome exercise in
the open air. This, however, he did not do. A few days after this, my
other clerks being absent, and being in a great hurry to dispatch
certain letters by the mail, I thought that, having nothing else
earthly to do, Bartleby would surely be less inflexible than usual, and
carry these letters to the post-office. But he blankly declined. So,
much to my inconvenience, I went myself.</p>
<p>Still added days went by. Whether Bartleby’s eyes improved or not, I
could not say. To all appearance, I thought they did. But when I asked
him if they did, he vouchsafed no answer. At all events, he would do no
copying. At last, in reply to my urgings, he informed me that he had
permanently given up copying.</p>
<p>“What!” exclaimed I; “suppose your eyes should get entirely well—better
than ever before—would you not copy then?”</p>
<p>“I have given up copying,” he answered, and slid aside.</p>
<p>He remained as ever, a fixture in my chamber. Nay—if that were
possible—he became still more of a fixture than before. What was to be
done? He would do nothing in the office: why should he stay there? In
plain fact, he had now become a millstone to me, not only useless as a
necklace, but afflictive to bear. Yet I was sorry for him. I speak less
than truth when I say that, on his own account, he occasioned me
uneasiness. If he would but have named a single relative or friend, I
would instantly have written, and urged their taking the poor fellow
away to some convenient retreat. But he seemed alone, absolutely alone
in the universe. A bit of wreck in the mid Atlantic. At length,
necessities connected with my business tyrannized over all other
considerations. Decently as I could, I told Bartleby that in six days’
time he must unconditionally leave the office. I warned him to take
measures, in the interval, for procuring some other abode. I offered to
assist him in this endeavor, if he himself would but take the first
step towards a removal. “And when you finally quit me, Bartleby,” added
I, “I shall see that you go not away entirely unprovided. Six days from
this hour, remember.”</p>
<p>At the expiration of that period, I peeped behind the screen, and lo!
Bartleby was there.</p>
<p>I buttoned up my coat, balanced myself; advanced slowly towards him,
touched his shoulder, and said, “The time has come; you must quit this
place; I am sorry for you; here is money; but you must go.”</p>
<p>“I would prefer not,” he replied, with his back still towards me.</p>
<p>“You <em>must</em>.”</p>
<p>He remained silent.</p>
<p>Now I had an unbounded confidence in this man’s common honesty. He had
frequently restored to me sixpences and shillings carelessly dropped
upon the floor, for I am apt to be very reckless in such shirt-button
affairs. The proceeding then which followed will not be deemed
extraordinary.</p>
<p>“Bartleby,” said I, “I owe you twelve dollars on account; here are
thirty-two; the odd twenty are yours.—Will you take it?” and I handed
the bills towards him.</p>
<p>But he made no motion.</p>
<p>“I will leave them here then,” putting them under a weight on the
table. Then taking my hat and cane and going to the door I tranquilly
turned and added—“After you have removed your things from these
offices, Bartleby, you will of course lock the door—since every one is
now gone for the day but you—and if you please, slip your key
underneath the mat, so that I may have it in the morning. I shall not
see you again; so good-bye to you. If hereafter in your new place of
abode I can be of any service to you, do not fail to advise me by
letter. Good-bye, Bartleby, and fare you well.”</p>
<p>But he answered not a word; like the last column of some ruined temple,
he remained standing mute and solitary in the middle of the otherwise
deserted room.</p>
<p>As I walked home in a pensive mood, my vanity got the better of my
pity. I could not but highly plume myself on my masterly management in
getting rid of Bartleby. Masterly I call it, and such it must appear to
any dispassionate thinker. The beauty of my procedure seemed to consist
in its perfect quietness. There was no vulgar bullying, no bravado of
any sort, no choleric hectoring, and striding to and fro across the
apartment, jerking out vehement commands for Bartleby to bundle himself
off with his beggarly traps. Nothing of the kind. Without loudly
bidding Bartleby depart—as an inferior genius might have done—I
<em>assumed</em> the ground that depart he must; and upon that assumption
built all I had to say. The more I thought over my procedure, the more
I was charmed with it. Nevertheless, next morning, upon awakening, I
had my doubts,—I had somehow slept off the fumes of vanity. One of the
coolest and wisest hours a man has, is just after he awakes in the
morning. My procedure seemed as sagacious as ever.—but only in theory.
How it would prove in practice—there was the rub. It was truly a
beautiful thought to have assumed Bartleby’s departure; but, after all,
that assumption was simply my own, and none of Bartleby’s. The great
point was, not whether I had assumed that he would quit me, but whether
he would prefer so to do. He was more a man of preferences than
assumptions.</p>
<p>After breakfast, I walked down town, arguing the probabilities <em>pro</em>
and <em>con</em>. One moment I thought it would prove a miserable failure, and
Bartleby would be found all alive at my office as usual; the next
moment it seemed certain that I should see his chair empty. And so I
kept veering about. At the corner of Broadway and Canal-street, I saw
quite an excited group of people standing in earnest conversation.</p>
<p>“I’ll take odds he doesn’t,” said a voice as I passed.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t go?—done!” said I, “put up your money.”</p>
<p>I was instinctively putting my hand in my pocket to produce my own,
when I remembered that this was an election day. The words I had
overheard bore no reference to Bartleby, but to the success or
non-success of some candidate for the mayoralty. In my intent frame of
mind, I had, as it were, imagined that all Broadway shared in my
excitement, and were debating the same question with me. I passed on,
very thankful that the uproar of the street screened my momentary
absent-mindedness.</p>
<p>As I had intended, I was earlier than usual at my office door. I stood
listening for a moment. All was still. He must be gone. I tried the
knob. The door was locked. Yes, my procedure had worked to a charm; he
indeed must be vanished. Yet a certain melancholy mixed with this: I
was almost sorry for my brilliant success. I was fumbling under the
door mat for the key, which Bartleby was to have left there for me,
when accidentally my knee knocked against a panel, producing a
summoning sound, and in response a voice came to me from within—“Not
yet; I am occupied.”</p>
<p>It was Bartleby.</p>
<p>I was thunderstruck. For an instant I stood like the man who, pipe in
mouth, was killed one cloudless afternoon long ago in Virginia, by a
summer lightning; at his own warm open window he was killed, and
remained leaning out there upon the dreamy afternoon, till some one
touched him, when he fell.</p>
<p>“Not gone!” I murmured at last. But again obeying that wondrous
ascendancy which the inscrutable scrivener had over me, and from which
ascendancy, for all my chafing, I could not completely escape, I slowly
went down stairs and out into the street, and while walking round the
block, considered what I should next do in this unheard-of perplexity.
Turn the man out by an actual thrusting I could not; to drive him away
by calling him hard names would not do; calling in the police was an
unpleasant idea; and yet, permit him to enjoy his cadaverous triumph
over me,—this too I could not think of. What was to be done? or, if
nothing could be done, was there any thing further that I could
<em>assume</em> in the matter? Yes, as before I had prospectively assumed that
Bartleby would depart, so now I might retrospectively assume that
departed he was. In the legitimate carrying out of this assumption, I
might enter my office in a great hurry, and pretending not to see
Bartleby at all, walk straight against him as if he were air. Such a
proceeding would in a singular degree have the appearance of a
home-thrust. It was hardly possible that Bartleby could withstand such
an application of the doctrine of assumptions. But upon second thoughts
the success of the plan seemed rather dubious. I resolved to argue the
matter over with him again.</p>
<p>“Bartleby,” said I, entering the office, with a quietly severe
expression, “I am seriously displeased. I am pained, Bartleby. I had
thought better of you. I had imagined you of such a gentlemanly
organization, that in any delicate dilemma a slight hint would have
suffice—in short, an assumption. But it appears I am deceived. Why,” I
added, unaffectedly starting, “you have not even touched that money
yet,” pointing to it, just where I had left it the evening previous.</p>
<p>He answered nothing.</p>
<p>“Will you, or will you not, quit me?” I now demanded in a sudden
passion, advancing close to him.</p>
<p>“I would prefer <em>not</em> to quit you,” he replied, gently emphasizing the
<em>not</em>.</p>
<p>“What earthly right have you to stay here? Do you pay any rent? Do you
pay my taxes? Or is this property yours?”</p>
<p>He answered nothing.</p>
<p>“Are you ready to go on and write now? Are your eyes recovered? Could
you copy a small paper for me this morning? or help examine a few
lines? or step round to the post-office? In a word, will you do any
thing at all, to give a coloring to your refusal to depart the
premises?”</p>
<p>He silently retired into his hermitage.</p>
<p>I was now in such a state of nervous resentment that I thought it but
prudent to check myself at present from further demonstrations.
Bartleby and I were alone. I remembered the tragedy of the unfortunate
Adams and the still more unfortunate Colt in the solitary office of the
latter; and how poor Colt, being dreadfully incensed by Adams, and
imprudently permitting himself to get wildly excited, was at unawares
hurried into his fatal act—an act which certainly no man could possibly
deplore more than the actor himself. Often it had occurred to me in my
ponderings upon the subject, that had that altercation taken place in
the public street, or at a private residence, it would not have
terminated as it did. It was the circumstance of being alone in a
solitary office, up stairs, of a building entirely unhallowed by
humanizing domestic associations—an uncarpeted office, doubtless, of a
dusty, haggard sort of appearance;—this it must have been, which
greatly helped to enhance the irritable desperation of the hapless
Colt.</p>
<p>But when this old Adam of resentment rose in me and tempted me
concerning Bartleby, I grappled him and threw him. How? Why, simply by
recalling the divine injunction: “A new commandment give I unto you,
that ye love one another.” Yes, this it was that saved me. Aside from
higher considerations, charity often operates as a vastly wise and
prudent principle—a great safeguard to its possessor. Men have
committed murder for jealousy’s sake, and anger’s sake, and hatred’s
sake, and selfishness’ sake, and spiritual pride’s sake; but no man
that ever I heard of, ever committed a diabolical murder for sweet
charity’s sake. Mere self-interest, then, if no better motive can be
enlisted, should, especially with high-tempered men, prompt all beings
to charity and philanthropy. At any rate, upon the occasion in
question, I strove to drown my exasperated feelings towards the
scrivener by benevolently construing his conduct. Poor fellow, poor
fellow! thought I, he don’t mean any thing; and besides, he has seen
hard times, and ought to be indulged.</p>
<p>I endeavored also immediately to occupy myself, and at the same time to
comfort my despondency. I tried to fancy that in the course of the
morning, at such time as might prove agreeable to him, Bartleby, of his
own free accord, would emerge from his hermitage, and take up some
decided line of march in the direction of the door. But no. Half-past
twelve o’clock came; Turkey began to glow in the face, overturn his
inkstand, and become generally obstreperous; Nippers abated down into
quietude and courtesy; Ginger Nut munched his noon apple; and Bartleby
remained standing at his window in one of his profoundest dead-wall
reveries. Will it be credited? Ought I to acknowledge it? That
afternoon I left the office without saying one further word to him.</p>
<p>Some days now passed, during which, at leisure intervals I looked a
little into “Edwards on the Will,” and “Priestly on Necessity.” Under
the circumstances, those books induced a salutary feeling. Gradually I
slid into the persuasion that these troubles of mine touching the
scrivener, had been all predestinated from eternity, and Bartleby was
billeted upon me for some mysterious purpose of an all-wise Providence,
which it was not for a mere mortal like me to fathom. Yes, Bartleby,
stay there behind your screen, thought I; I shall persecute you no
more; you are harmless and noiseless as any of these old chairs; in
short, I never feel so private as when I know you are here. At last I
see it, I feel it; I penetrate to the predestinated purpose of my life.
I am content. Others may have loftier parts to enact; but my mission in
this world, Bartleby, is to furnish you with office-room for such
period as you may see fit to remain.</p>
<p>I believe that this wise and blessed frame of mind would have continued
with me, had it not been for the unsolicited and uncharitable remarks
obtruded upon me by my professional friends who visited the rooms. But
thus it often is, that the constant friction of illiberal minds wears
out at last the best resolves of the more generous. Though to be sure,
when I reflected upon it, it was not strange that people entering my
office should be struck by the peculiar aspect of the unaccountable
Bartleby, and so be tempted to throw out some sinister observations
concerning him. Sometimes an attorney having business with me, and
calling at my office and finding no one but the scrivener there, would
undertake to obtain some sort of precise information from him touching
my whereabouts; but without heeding his idle talk, Bartleby would
remain standing immovable in the middle of the room. So after
contemplating him in that position for a time, the attorney would
depart, no wiser than he came.</p>
<p>Also, when a Reference was going on, and the room full of lawyers and
witnesses and business was driving fast; some deeply occupied legal
gentleman present, seeing Bartleby wholly unemployed, would request him
to run round to his (the legal gentleman’s) office and fetch some
papers for him. Thereupon, Bartleby would tranquilly decline, and yet
remain idle as before. Then the lawyer would give a great stare, and
turn to me. And what could I say? At last I was made aware that all
through the circle of my professional acquaintance, a whisper of wonder
was running round, having reference to the strange creature I kept at
my office. This worried me very much. And as the idea came upon me of
his possibly turning out a long-lived man, and keep occupying my
chambers, and denying my authority; and perplexing my visitors; and
scandalizing my professional reputation; and casting a general gloom
over the premises; keeping soul and body together to the last upon his
savings (for doubtless he spent but half a dime a day), and in the end
perhaps outlive me, and claim possession of my office by right of his
perpetual occupancy: as all these dark anticipations crowded upon me
more and more, and my friends continually intruded their relentless
remarks upon the apparition in my room; a great change was wrought in
me. I resolved to gather all my faculties together, and for ever rid me
of this intolerable incubus.</p>
<p>Ere revolving any complicated project, however, adapted to this end, I
first simply suggested to Bartleby the propriety of his permanent
departure. In a calm and serious tone, I commended the idea to his
careful and mature consideration. But having taken three days to
meditate upon it, he apprised me that his original determination
remained the same; in short, that he still preferred to abide with me.</p>
<p>What shall I do? I now said to myself, buttoning up my coat to the last
button. What shall I do? what ought I to do? what does conscience say I
<em>should</em> do with this man, or rather ghost. Rid myself of him, I must;
go, he shall. But how? You will not thrust him, the poor, pale, passive
mortal,—you will not thrust such a helpless creature out of your door?
you will not dishonor yourself by such cruelty? No, I will not, I
cannot do that. Rather would I let him live and die here, and then
mason up his remains in the wall. What then will you do? For all your
coaxing, he will not budge. Bribes he leaves under your own paperweight
on your table; in short, it is quite plain that he prefers to cling to
you.</p>
<p>Then something severe, something unusual must be done. What! surely you
will not have him collared by a constable, and commit his innocent
pallor to the common jail? And upon what ground could you procure such
a thing to be done?—a vagrant, is he? What! he a vagrant, a wanderer,
who refuses to budge? It is because he will <em>not</em> be a vagrant, then,
that you seek to count him <em>as</em> a vagrant. That is too absurd. No
visible means of support: there I have him. Wrong again: for
indubitably he <em>does</em> support himself, and that is the only
unanswerable proof that any man can show of his possessing the means so
to do. No more then. Since he will not quit me, I must quit him. I will
change my offices; I will move elsewhere; and give him fair notice,
that if I find him on my new premises I will then proceed against him
as a common trespasser.</p>
<p>Acting accordingly, next day I thus addressed him: “I find these
chambers too far from the City Hall; the air is unwholesome. In a word,
I propose to remove my offices next week, and shall no longer require
your services. I tell you this now, in order that you may seek another
place.”</p>
<p>He made no reply, and nothing more was said.</p>
<p>On the appointed day I engaged carts and men, proceeded to my chambers,
and having but little furniture, every thing was removed in a few
hours. Throughout, the scrivener remained standing behind the screen,
which I directed to be removed the last thing. It was withdrawn; and
being folded up like a huge folio, left him the motionless occupant of
a naked room. I stood in the entry watching him a moment, while
something from within me upbraided me.</p>
<p>I re-entered, with my hand in my pocket—and—and my heart in my mouth.</p>
<p>“Good-bye, Bartleby; I am going—good-bye, and God some way bless you;
and take that,” slipping something in his hand. But it dropped upon the
floor, and then,—strange to say—I tore myself from him whom I had so
longed to be rid of.</p>
<p>Established in my new quarters, for a day or two I kept the door
locked, and started at every footfall in the passages. When I returned
to my rooms after any little absence, I would pause at the threshold
for an instant, and attentively listen, ere applying my key. But these
fears were needless. Bartleby never came nigh me.</p>
<p>I thought all was going well, when a perturbed looking stranger visited
me, inquiring whether I was the person who had recently occupied rooms
at No.—Wall-street.</p>
<p>Full of forebodings, I replied that I was.</p>
<p>“Then sir,” said the stranger, who proved a lawyer, “you are
responsible for the man you left there. He refuses to do any copying;
he refuses to do any thing; he says he prefers not to; and he refuses
to quit the premises.”</p>
<p>“I am very sorry, sir,” said I, with assumed tranquility, but an inward
tremor, “but, really, the man you allude to is nothing to me—he is no
relation or apprentice of mine, that you should hold me responsible for
him.”</p>
<p>“In mercy’s name, who is he?”</p>
<p>“I certainly cannot inform you. I know nothing about him. Formerly I
employed him as a copyist; but he has done nothing for me now for some
time past.”</p>
<p>“I shall settle him then,—good morning, sir.”</p>
<p>Several days passed, and I heard nothing more; and though I often felt
a charitable prompting to call at the place and see poor Bartleby, yet
a certain squeamishness of I know not what withheld me.</p>
<p>All is over with him, by this time, thought I at last, when through
another week no further intelligence reached me. But coming to my room
the day after, I found several persons waiting at my door in a high
state of nervous excitement.</p>
<p>“That’s the man—here he comes,” cried the foremost one, whom I
recognized as the lawyer who had previously called upon me alone.</p>
<p>“You must take him away, sir, at once,” cried a portly person among
them, advancing upon me, and whom I knew to be the landlord of
No.—Wall-street. “These gentlemen, my tenants, cannot stand it any
longer; Mr. B—” pointing to the lawyer, “has turned him out of his
room, and he now persists in haunting the building generally, sitting
upon the banisters of the stairs by day, and sleeping in the entry by
night. Every body is concerned; clients are leaving the offices; some
fears are entertained of a mob; something you must do, and that without
delay.”</p>
<p>Aghast at this torrent, I fell back before it, and would fain have
locked myself in my new quarters. In vain I persisted that Bartleby was
nothing to me—no more than to any one else. In vain:—I was the last
person known to have any thing to do with him, and they held me to the
terrible account. Fearful then of being exposed in the papers (as one
person present obscurely threatened) I considered the matter, and at
length said, that if the lawyer would give me a confidential interview
with the scrivener, in his (the lawyer’s) own room, I would that
afternoon strive my best to rid them of the nuisance they complained
of.</p>
<p>Going up stairs to my old haunt, there was Bartleby silently sitting
upon the banister at the landing.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here, Bartleby?” said I.</p>
<p>“Sitting upon the banister,” he mildly replied.</p>
<p>I motioned him into the lawyer’s room, who then left us.</p>
<p>“Bartleby,” said I, “are you aware that you are the cause of great
tribulation to me, by persisting in occupying the entry after being
dismissed from the office?”</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>“Now one of two things must take place. Either you must do something,
or something must be done to you. Now what sort of business would you
like to engage in? Would you like to re-engage in copying for some
one?”</p>
<p>“No; I would prefer not to make any change.”</p>
<p>“Would you like a clerkship in a dry-goods store?”</p>
<p>“There is too much confinement about that. No, I would not like a
clerkship; but I am not particular.”</p>
<p>“Too much confinement,” I cried, “why you keep yourself confined all
the time!”</p>
<p>“I would prefer not to take a clerkship,” he rejoined, as if to settle
that little item at once.</p>
<p>“How would a bar-tender’s business suit you? There is no trying of the
eyesight in that.”</p>
<p>“I would not like it at all; though, as I said before, I am not
particular.”</p>
<p>His unwonted wordiness inspirited me. I returned to the charge.</p>
<p>“Well then, would you like to travel through the country collecting
bills for the merchants? That would improve your health.”</p>
<p>“No, I would prefer to be doing something else.”</p>
<p>“How then would going as a companion to Europe, to entertain some young
gentleman with your conversation,—how would that suit you?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. It does not strike me that there is any thing definite
about that. I like to be stationary. But I am not particular.”</p>
<p>“Stationary you shall be then,” I cried, now losing all patience, and
for the first time in all my exasperating connection with him fairly
flying into a passion. “If you do not go away from these premises
before night, I shall feel bound—indeed I <em>am</em> bound—to—to—to quit the
premises myself!” I rather absurdly concluded, knowing not with what
possible threat to try to frighten his immobility into compliance.
Despairing of all further efforts, I was precipitately leaving him,
when a final thought occurred to me—one which had not been wholly
unindulged before.</p>
<p>“Bartleby,” said I, in the kindest tone I could assume under such
exciting circumstances, “will you go home with me now—not to my office,
but my dwelling—and remain there till we can conclude upon some
convenient arrangement for you at our leisure? Come, let us start now,
right away.”</p>
<p>“No: at present I would prefer not to make any change at all.”</p>
<p>I answered nothing; but effectually dodging every one by the suddenness
and rapidity of my flight, rushed from the building, ran up Wall-street
towards Broadway, and jumping into the first omnibus was soon removed
from pursuit. As soon as tranquility returned I distinctly perceived
that I had now done all that I possibly could, both in respect to the
demands of the landlord and his tenants, and with regard to my own
desire and sense of duty, to benefit Bartleby, and shield him from rude
persecution. I now strove to be entirely care-free and quiescent; and
my conscience justified me in the attempt; though indeed it was not so
successful as I could have wished. So fearful was I of being again
hunted out by the incensed landlord and his exasperated tenants, that,
surrendering my business to Nippers, for a few days I drove about the
upper part of the town and through the suburbs, in my rockaway; crossed
over to Jersey City and Hoboken, and paid fugitive visits to
Manhattanville and Astoria. In fact I almost lived in my rockaway for
the time.</p>
<p>When again I entered my office, lo, a note from the landlord lay upon
the desk. I opened it with trembling hands. It informed me that the
writer had sent to the police, and had Bartleby removed to the Tombs as
a vagrant. Moreover, since I knew more about him than any one else, he
wished me to appear at that place, and make a suitable statement of the
facts. These tidings had a conflicting effect upon me. At first I was
indignant; but at last almost approved. The landlord’s energetic,
summary disposition had led him to adopt a procedure which I do not
think I would have decided upon myself; and yet as a last resort, under
such peculiar circumstances, it seemed the only plan.</p>
<p>As I afterwards learned, the poor scrivener, when told that he must be
conducted to the Tombs, offered not the slightest obstacle, but in his
pale unmoving way, silently acquiesced.</p>
<p>Some of the compassionate and curious bystanders joined the party; and
headed by one of the constables arm in arm with Bartleby, the silent
procession filed its way through all the noise, and heat, and joy of
the roaring thoroughfares at noon.</p>
<p>The same day I received the note I went to the Tombs, or to speak more
properly, the Halls of Justice. Seeking the right officer, I stated the
purpose of my call, and was informed that the individual I described
was indeed within. I then assured the functionary that Bartleby was a
perfectly honest man, and greatly to be compassionated, however
unaccountably eccentric. I narrated all I knew, and closed by
suggesting the idea of letting him remain in as indulgent confinement
as possible till something less harsh might be done—though indeed I
hardly knew what. At all events, if nothing else could be decided upon,
the alms-house must receive him. I then begged to have an interview.</p>
<p>Being under no disgraceful charge, and quite serene and harmless in all
his ways, they had permitted him freely to wander about the prison, and
especially in the inclosed grass-platted yard thereof. And so I found
him there, standing all alone in the quietest of the yards, his face
towards a high wall, while all around, from the narrow slits of the
jail windows, I thought I saw peering out upon him the eyes of
murderers and thieves.</p>
<p>“Bartleby!”</p>
<p>“I know you,” he said, without looking round,—“and I want nothing to
say to you.”</p>
<p>“It was not I that brought you here, Bartleby,” said I, keenly pained
at his implied suspicion. “And to you, this should not be so vile a
place. Nothing reproachful attaches to you by being here. And see, it
is not so sad a place as one might think. Look, there is the sky, and
here is the grass.”</p>
<p>“I know where I am,” he replied, but would say nothing more, and so I
left him.</p>
<p>As I entered the corridor again, a broad meat-like man, in an apron,
accosted me, and jerking his thumb over his shoulder said—“Is that your
friend?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Does he want to starve? If he does, let him live on the prison fare,
that’s all.”</p>
<p>“Who are you?” asked I, not knowing what to make of such an
unofficially speaking person in such a place.</p>
<p>“I am the grub-man. Such gentlemen as have friends here, hire me to
provide them with something good to eat.”</p>
<p>“Is this so?” said I, turning to the turnkey.</p>
<p>He said it was.</p>
<p>“Well then,” said I, slipping some silver into the grub-man’s hands
(for so they called him). “I want you to give particular attention to
my friend there; let him have the best dinner you can get. And you must
be as polite to him as possible.”</p>
<p>“Introduce me, will you?” said the grub-man, looking at me with an
expression which seemed to say he was all impatience for an opportunity
to give a specimen of his breeding.</p>
<p>Thinking it would prove of benefit to the scrivener, I acquiesced; and
asking the grub-man his name, went up with him to Bartleby.</p>
<p>“Bartleby, this is Mr. Cutlets; you will find him very useful to you.”</p>
<p>“Your sarvant, sir, your sarvant,” said the grub-man, making a low
salutation behind his apron. “Hope you find it pleasant here,
sir;—spacious grounds—cool apartments, sir—hope you’ll stay with us
some time—try to make it agreeable. May Mrs. Cutlets and I have the
pleasure of your company to dinner, sir, in Mrs. Cutlets’ private
room?”</p>
<p>“I prefer not to dine to-day,” said Bartleby, turning away. “It would
disagree with me; I am unused to dinners.” So saying he slowly moved to
the other side of the inclosure, and took up a position fronting the
dead-wall.</p>
<p>“How’s this?” said the grub-man, addressing me with a stare of
astonishment. “He’s odd, aint he?”</p>
<p>“I think he is a little deranged,” said I, sadly.</p>
<p>“Deranged? deranged is it? Well now, upon my word, I thought that
friend of yourn was a gentleman forger; they are always pale and
genteel-like, them forgers. I can’t pity’em—can’t help it, sir. Did you
know Monroe Edwards?” he added touchingly, and paused. Then, laying his
hand pityingly on my shoulder, sighed, “he died of consumption at
Sing-Sing. So you weren’t acquainted with Monroe?”</p>
<p>“No, I was never socially acquainted with any forgers. But I cannot
stop longer. Look to my friend yonder. You will not lose by it. I will
see you again.”</p>
<p>Some few days after this, I again obtained admission to the Tombs, and
went through the corridors in quest of Bartleby; but without finding
him.</p>
<p>“I saw him coming from his cell not long ago,” said a turnkey, “may be
he’s gone to loiter in the yards.”</p>
<p>So I went in that direction.</p>
<p>“Are you looking for the silent man?” said another turnkey passing me.
“Yonder he lies—sleeping in the yard there. ’Tis not twenty minutes
since I saw him lie down.”</p>
<p>The yard was entirely quiet. It was not accessible to the common
prisoners. The surrounding walls, of amazing thickness, kept off all
sounds behind them. The Egyptian character of the masonry weighed upon
me with its gloom. But a soft imprisoned turf grew under foot. The
heart of the eternal pyramids, it seemed, wherein, by some strange
magic, through the clefts, grass-seed, dropped by birds, had sprung.</p>
<p>Strangely huddled at the base of the wall, his knees drawn up, and
lying on his side, his head touching the cold stones, I saw the wasted
Bartleby. But nothing stirred. I paused; then went close up to him;
stooped over, and saw that his dim eyes were open; otherwise he seemed
profoundly sleeping. Something prompted me to touch him. I felt his
hand, when a tingling shiver ran up my arm and down my spine to my
feet.</p>
<p>The round face of the grub-man peered upon me now. “His dinner is
ready. Won’t he dine to-day, either? Or does he live without dining?”</p>
<p>“Lives without dining,” said I, and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>“Eh!—He’s asleep, aint he?”</p>
<p>“With kings and counselors,” murmured I.</p>
<p>There would seem little need for proceeding further in this history.
Imagination will readily supply the meager recital of poor Bartleby’s
interment. But ere parting with the reader, let me say, that if this
little narrative has sufficiently interested him, to awaken curiosity
as to who Bartleby was, and what manner of life he led prior to the
present narrator’s making his acquaintance, I can only reply, that in
such curiosity I fully share, but am wholly unable to gratify it. Yet
here I hardly know whether I should divulge one little item of rumor,
which came to my ear a few months after the scrivener’s decease. Upon
what basis it rested, I could never ascertain; and hence, how true it
is I cannot now tell. But inasmuch as this vague report has not been
without certain strange suggestive interest to me, however sad, it may
prove the same with some others; and so I will briefly mention it. The
report was this: that Bartleby had been a subordinate clerk in the Dead
Letter Office at Washington, from which he had been suddenly removed by
a change in the administration. When I think over this rumor, I cannot
adequately express the emotions which seize me. Dead letters! does it
not sound like dead men? Conceive a man by nature and misfortune prone
to a pallid hopelessness, can any business seem more fitted to heighten
it than that of continually handling these dead letters, and assorting
them for the flames? For by the cart-load they are annually burned.
Sometimes from out the folded paper the pale clerk takes a ring:—the
finger it was meant for, perhaps, moulders in the grave; a bank-note
sent in swiftest charity:—he whom it would relieve, nor eats nor
hungers any more; pardon for those who died despairing; hope for those
who died unhoping; good tidings for those who died stifled by
unrelieved calamities. On errands of life, these letters speed to
death.</p>
<p>Ah Bartleby! Ah humanity!</p>

                    <p>Sóc un home d&rsquo;edat avançada. La naturalesa de la meva feina durant els darrers trenta anys m&rsquo;ha posat en contacte, més del que és habitual, amb un grup d&rsquo;homes interessant i una mica peculiar, del qual encara no s&rsquo;ha escrit res, que jo sàpiga: em refereixo als escrivans de documents legals. N&rsquo;he conegut molts, tant professionalment com personalment, i si volgués, podria explicar diverses històries que farien somriure la gent benèvola i plorar les ànimes sensibles. Però deixo de banda les biografies de tots els altres escrivans per centrar-me en alguns passatges de la vida de Bartleby, que va ser l&rsquo;escrivà més estrany que havia conegut mai. Mentre que d&rsquo;altres copistes de documents legals podria escriure&rsquo;n la vida completa, de Bartleby no es pot fer res semblant. Crec que no existeixen materials per a una biografia completa i satisfactòria d&rsquo;aquest home. És una pèrdua irreparable per a la literatura. Bartleby va ser un d&rsquo;aquells éssers dels quals no es pot saber res, excepte a partir de fonts directes, i en el seu cas aquestes són molt poques. El que els meus propis ulls sorpresos van veure de Bartleby, això és tot el que en sé, excepte un informe vague que apareixerà més endavant.</p>
<p>Abans de presentar l&rsquo;escrivà tal com el vaig conèixer per primera vegada, convé que parli una mica de mi mateix, dels meus empleats, del meu negoci, del meu despatx i de l&rsquo;entorn general, perquè aquesta descripció és indispensable per comprendre adequadament el personatge principal que estic a punt de presentar.</p>
<p>Temps abans del període en què comença aquesta petita història, la meva feina havia augmentat molt. El bon i vell càrrec, ara extingit a l&rsquo;Estat de Nova York, de Mestre de la Cancelleria, m&rsquo;havia estat concedit. No era un càrrec gaire feixuc, però sí molt ben remunerat. Rares vegades perdo els estreps; molt més rarament m&rsquo;abandono a una indignació perillosa davant d&rsquo;injustícies i atropells. Però he de ser franc i declarar que considero l&rsquo;abolició sobtada i violenta del càrrec de Mestre de la Cancelleria per part de la nova Constitució com un acte&hellip; prematur. Jo comptava amb uns beneficis de per vida, però només vaig rebre els d&rsquo;uns pocs anys breus. Però això és de passada.</p>
<p>El meu despatx estava a dalt, al número&hellip; de Wall Street. A un extrem donava a la paret blanca de l&rsquo;interior d&rsquo;un espaiós pou de llum que travessava l&rsquo;edifici de dalt a baix. Aquesta vista podria haver estat considerada més aviat sosa, mancada del que els pintors de paisatges anomenen «vida». Però, si era així, la vista des de l&rsquo;altre extrem del meu despatx oferia, almenys, un contrast, si no res més. En aquella direcció les meves finestres donaven a una vista sense obstacles d&rsquo;un alt mur de totxo, ennegrit pels anys i per l&rsquo;ombra perpètua; un mur que no requeria cap catalejo per revelar les seves belleses amagades, sinó que, en benefici de tots els espectadors miopics, s&rsquo;alçava a menys de tres metres dels meus vidres. A causa de la gran alçada dels edificis del voltant, i estant el meu despatx al segon pis, l&rsquo;interval entre aquest mur i el meu s&rsquo;assemblava no poc a una enorme cisterna quadrada.</p>
<p>Poc abans que arribés Bartleby, jo tenia dos copistes i un jove prometedor com a aprenent d&rsquo;oficina. El primer es deia Turkey; el segon, Nippers; el tercer, Ginger Nut. Són noms que no trobaríeu mai al cens. De fet, eren sobrenoms que els meus tres empleats s&rsquo;havien posat mútuament, i expressaven bé el caràcter de cadascú. Turkey era un anglès baix i grassonet de la meva edat, cap als seixanta. Al matí tenia la cara d&rsquo;un bell color sonrosat, però després de les dotze del migdia —l&rsquo;hora de dinar— li brillava com una llar plena de carbons de Nadal; i seguia brillant —però minvant gradualment— fins a les sis de la tarda, i després d&rsquo;aquesta hora ja no el veia més. El propietari d&rsquo;aquella cara, que assolía el seu migdia amb el sol, semblava pondre&rsquo;s amb ell, per tornar a sortir, culminar i declinar l&rsquo;endemà, amb la mateixa regularitat i glòria inextingible. He conegut moltes coincidències singulars al llarg de la meva vida, i no la menor va ser que exactament quan Turkey desplegava tots els seus raigs amb aquella cara roja i resplandent, precisament llavors també, en aquell moment crític, començava el període diari en què les seves aptituds per la feina es pertorbaven seriosament durant la resta de les vint-i-quatre hores. No és que fos del tot mandrós o reticent a treballar; ben al contrari. El problema era que tendia a ser excessivament enèrgic. Hi havia una estranya activitat inflamada, atrafegada i eixelebrada en ell. Era imprudent a l&rsquo;hora de mullar la ploma al tinter. Totes les taques als meus documents caien allà després de les dotze del migdia. De fet, no només era imprudent i molt donat a fer taques a la tarda, sinó que alguns dies anava més lluny i era força sorollós. En aquests moments, també, la seva cara flamejava amb una brillantor augmentada, com si s&rsquo;hagués apilat carbó de candela sobre l&rsquo;antracita. Feia un soroll desagradable amb la cadira; vessava la caixa de sorra; en adobar les plomes, les esquinçava totes impacientment i les llençava a terra en un accés de ràbia; s&rsquo;alçava i s&rsquo;inclinava sobre la taula, remenant els papers d&rsquo;una manera molt indecorosa, molt trist de veure en un home gran com ell. No obstant això, com que era en molts aspectes una persona molt valuosa per a mi, i tot el temps abans de les dotze del migdia era la criatura més ràpida i constant, realitzant una gran quantitat de feina amb un estil difícil d&rsquo;igualar, per aquestes raons jo estava disposat a passar per alt les seves excentricitats, encara que, certament, de vegades li&rsquo;n feia retret. Això ho feia molt suaument, però, perquè, tot i ser el més civilitzat, és més, el més afable i reverencial dels homes al matí, a la tarda estava disposat, si se&rsquo;l provocava, a ser una mica impetuós amb la llengua, de fet, insolent. Ara bé, valorant els seus serveis matinals com ho feia, i resolt a no perdre&rsquo;ls, però alhora incòmode amb les seves maneres enceses després de les dotze, i sent un home de pau, poc disposat a provocar amb les meves amonestacions rèpliques inconvenients per part seva, em vaig prendre la llibertat, un dissabte al migdia (sempre estava pitjor els dissabtes), d&rsquo;insinuar-li, molt amablement, que potser ara que es feia gran, li convindria escurçar les seves feines; en resum, que no calia que vingués al despatx després de les dotze, sinó que, un cop acabat el dinar, era millor que anés a casa seva a descansar fins a l&rsquo;hora del te. Però no; va insistir en les seves devocions de la tarda. La seva cara es va tornar insuportablement fèrvida, mentre m&rsquo;assegurava oratòriament, gesticulant amb un regle llarg a l&rsquo;altre extrem de l&rsquo;habitació, que si els seus serveis al matí eren útils, com d&rsquo;indispensables, doncs, eren a la tarda?</p>
<p>—Amb el degut respecte, senyor —va dir Turkey en aquesta ocasió—, em considero la vostra mà dreta. Al matí no faig més que ordenar i desplegar les meves columnes; però a la tarda em poso al capdavant i carrego galantment contra l&rsquo;enemic, així! —i va fer una estocada violenta amb el regle.</p>
<p>—Però les taques, Turkey —li vaig insinuar.</p>
<p>—És cert&hellip; però, amb el degut respecte, senyor, mireu aquests cabells! M&rsquo;estic fent vell. Segurament, senyor, una taca o dues en una tarda calorosa no s&rsquo;ha de considerar un greuge greu contra els cabells grisos. La vellesa, encara que taqui la pàgina, és honorable. Amb el degut respecte, senyor, tots dos ens estem fent vells.</p>
<p>Aquest apel·lament al meu sentiment de solidaritat era gairebé irresistible. En tot cas, vaig veure que no se n&rsquo;aniria pas. Així que vaig decidir deixar-lo quedar, tot resolent, tanmateix, vigilar que durant la tarda només tingués a veure amb els meus papers menys importants.</p>
<p>Pinces, el segon de la meva llista, era un jove d&rsquo;uns vint-i-cinc anys amb patilles, de cara groga i, en general, d&rsquo;aspecte força piràtic. Sempre el vaig considerar víctima de dues forces malignes: l&rsquo;ambició i la indigestió. L&rsquo;ambició es manifestava en una certa impaciència davant els deures d&rsquo;un simple copista, una usurpació injustificada d&rsquo;afers estrictament professionals, com la redacció original de documents legals. La indigestió semblava evidenciar-se en un nerviosisme irritable ocasional i una irritabilitat que feia por, provocant que les dents grinyolessin fort per errors comesos en copiar. També es manifestava amb malediccions innecessàries, més murmurades que pronunciades, enmig de la feina, i especialment en un descontentament constant amb l&rsquo;altura de la taula on treballava. Tot i tenir una habilitat mecànica molt enginyosa, Pinces no aconseguia mai que aquesta taula li anés bé. Hi posava tascals a sota, blocs de diverses menes, trossos de cartó, i finalment va arribar tan lluny com a intentar un ajustament exquisit amb trossos de paper secant plegat. Però cap invent no servia. Si, per alleugerir l&rsquo;esquena, aixecava la tapa de la taula en un angle agut fins gairebé a la barbeta i escrivia com un home que fes servir el teulat inclinat d&rsquo;una casa holandesa com a escriptori, llavors declarava que li tallava la circulació dels braços. Si ara abaixava la taula fins a la cintura i s&rsquo;inclinava per escriure, llavors li feia mal l&rsquo;esquena. En resum, la veritat de l&rsquo;afer era que Pinces no sabia què volia. O, si volia alguna cosa, era desfer-se del tot de la taula d&rsquo;escrivent. Entre les manifestacions de la seva ambició malaltissa hi havia l&rsquo;afició de rebre visites de certs individus d&rsquo;aspecte ambigu amb abrics gastats, als quals anomenava els seus clients. De fet, jo sabia que no només era, de vegades, un polític de barri considerable, sinó que ocasionalment feia algun negoci als jutjats de pau, i no era desconegut a les escales de les Tombes. Tinc bones raons per creure, tanmateix, que un individu que el va visitar al meu despatx, i que, amb grans aires, va insistir que era el seu client, no era altre que un cobrador de deutes, i el suposat títol de propietat, una factura. Però amb tots els seus defectes, i les molèsties que em causava, Pinces, com el seu compatriota Turkey, era un home molt útil per a mi; escrivia amb lletra clara i ràpida; i, quan volia, no li faltava una certa mena de comportament distingit. A més, sempre es vestia d&rsquo;una manera distingida; i així, de passada, donava crèdit als meus locals. Mentre que respecte a Turkey, em costava molt evitar que fos un motiu de vergonya per a mi. La seva roba tendia a semblar oliosa i olorar a tavernes. Portava els pantalons molt amples i caiguts a l&rsquo;estiu. Les seves jaquetes eren execrables; el seu barret, millor no tocar-lo. Però mentre el barret m&rsquo;era indiferent, ja que la seva civilitat natural i deferència, com a anglès dependent, sempre el portava a treure-se&rsquo;l tan bon punt entrava a l&rsquo;habitació, la jaqueta era una altra cosa. Sobre les seves jaquetes, vaig raonar amb ell; però sense cap efecte. La veritat era, suposo, que un home amb uns ingressos tan escassos no es podia permetre lluir una cara tan llustrosa i una jaqueta tan llustrosa alhora. Com Pinces va observar una vegada, els diners de Turkey anaven principalment a la tinta vermella. Un dia d&rsquo;hivern li vaig regalar una jaqueta meva de molt bona presència, una jaqueta grisa folrada, molt càlida, que s&rsquo;abototonava de dalt a baix des del genoll fins al coll. Pensava que Turkey apreciaria el favor i moderaria la seva impetuositat i soroll de les tardes. Però no. Veritablement crec que abotonar-se amb aquella jaqueta tan tova i de manta va tenir un efecte perniciós sobre ell; pel mateix principi que massa civada és dolenta per als cavalls. De fet, precisament com es diu que un cavall impetuós i inquiet sent la seva civada, així Turkey sentia la seva jaqueta. El va fer insolent. Era un home a qui la prosperitat perjudicava.</p>
<p>Encara que sobre els hàbits autoindulgents de Turkey tenia les meves sospites, pel que feia a Nippers estava ben convençut que, qualsevol que fossin els seus defectes en altres aspectes, almenys era un jove moderat. Però la pròpia natura semblava haver fet de vinyater amb ell. En néixer l&rsquo;havia dotat tan profundament d&rsquo;un temperament irritable i ardent com l&rsquo;aiguardent, que qualsevol beguda posterior resultava innecessària.</p>
<p>Quan recordo com, enmig del silenci del meu despatx, Nippers a vegades s&rsquo;alçava impacient del seu seient i, inclinant-se sobre la taula, obria els braços del tot, agafava tot el pupitre i el movia, el sacsejava amb un moviment aspre i eixordador pel terra, com si la taula fos un agent voluntari i pervers, obstinat a contrariar-lo i irritar-lo, entenc clarament que per a Nippers l&rsquo;aiguardent amb aigua era del tot superflu.</p>
<p>Va ser afortunat per a mi que, a causa del seu origen peculiar —la indigestió—, la irritabilitat i nerviositat de Nippers s&rsquo;observaven principalment al matí, mentre que a la tarda era comparativament tranquil. Com que els paroxismes de Turkey només apareixien cap a les dotze, mai no vaig haver de bregar amb les excentricitats dels dos alhora. Els seus accesos es rellevaven mútuament com sentinelles. Quan el de Nippers estava actiu, el de Turkey restava inactiu, i viceversa. Aquest arranjament natural funcionava bé en aquelles circumstàncies.</p>
<p>Galeta de Gingebre, el tercer de la meva llista, era un noi d&rsquo;uns dotze anys. El seu pare era carreter, amb l&rsquo;ambició de veure el seu fill al tribunal en lloc d&rsquo;anant amb el carro abans de morir. Per això el va enviar al meu despatx com a estudiant de dret, ordinari i netejador, a raó d&rsquo;un dòlar per setmana. Tenia un petit escriptori per a ell sol, però no l&rsquo;usava gaire. Si inspecciones el calaix, hi havia una gran varietat d&rsquo;esquerdes de tota mena de fruits secs. Per a aquest jovenot d&rsquo;esperit viu, tota la noble ciència del dret cabia en una closca de nous. No era la menor de les feines de Galeta de Gingebre, i també una de les que feia amb més ganes, la seva tasca de portar pastissets i pomes a Gall Dindi i Tenalles. Copiar documents legals és cosa sabuda que és un ofici sec i àrid, de manera que els meus dos copistes havien de mullar-se la boca molt sovint amb Spitzenbergs que es trobaven a les nombroses parades prop de la Duana i Correus. També enviaven Galeta de Gingebre molt sovint a buscar aquell pastisset particular —petit, pla, rodó i molt especiat— del qual havia rebut el nom. En un matí fred, quan la feina anava fluixa, Gall Dindi s&rsquo;engolia dotzenes d&rsquo;aquests pastissos com si fossin simples neules —de fet, els venen a raó de sis o vuit per un penique— i el raspeig de la seva ploma es barrejava amb el cruixir de les partícules cruixents a la seva boca. De tots els errors encesos de la tarda i les precipitacions de Turkey, el pitjor va ser quan va humitejar una galeta de gingebre entre els llavis i la va enganxar a una hipoteca com a segell. Vaig estar a punt d&rsquo;acomiadar-lo llavors. Però em va amansar fent una reverència oriental i dient: «Amb el degut respecte, senyor, ha estat generós per part meva proporcionar-vos material d&rsquo;oficina del meu propi compte.»</p>
<p>Hauria d&rsquo;haver dit abans que unes portes plegadisses de vidre esmerilat dividien el meu despatx en dues parts, una ocupada pels meus copistes, l&rsquo;altra per mi. Segons em venia de gust, obria aquestes portes o les tancava. Vaig decidir assignar a Bartleby un racó al costat de les portes plegadisses, però del meu costat, de manera que tingués aquest home silenciós a mà, per si calia fer alguna cosa sense importància. Vaig col·locar el seu escriptori prop d&rsquo;una petita finestra lateral d&rsquo;aquella part de l&rsquo;habitació, una finestra que originalment havia ofert una vista lateral de certs patis bruts i maons, però que, a causa de construccions posteriors, ara no donava a enlloc, tot i que deixava entrar una mica de llum. A tres peus dels vidres hi havia una paret, i la llum baixava de molt amunt, entre dos edificis alts, com d&rsquo;una obertura molt petita en una cúpula. Per acabar d&rsquo;arrodonir la situació, vaig comprar un biombo alt i verd que pogués aïllar completament Bartleby de la meva vista, sense allunyar-lo però de la meva veu. I així, d&rsquo;alguna manera, privacitat i companyia es combinaven.</p>
<p>Al principi Bartleby va fer una quantitat extraordinària d&rsquo;escriptura. Com si hagués tingut gana molt de temps de quelcom per copiar, semblava fartar-se dels meus documents. No hi havia cap pausa per a la digestió. Treballava dia i nit sense parar, copiant amb llum solar i amb llum de candela. M&rsquo;hauria delectat força amb la seva aplicació, si hagués estat alegrement industriós. Però escrivia en silenci, pàl·lid, mecànicament.</p>
<p>És, naturalment, una part indispensable de la feina d&rsquo;un escrivent verificar l&rsquo;exactitud de la seva còpia, paraula per paraula. Quan hi ha dos o més escrivents en una oficina, s&rsquo;ajuden mútuament en aquest examen: un llegeix de la còpia mentre l&rsquo;altre sosté l&rsquo;original. És un afer molt avorrit, fatigós i letàrgic. Puc imaginar fàcilment que per a alguns temperaments sanguinis seria del tot insuportable. Per exemple, no em crec que el poeta fogós Byron s&rsquo;hagués assegut de bon grat amb Bartleby per examinar un document legal de, posem per cas, cinc-centes pàgines, escrites a mà amb lletra atapeïda.</p>
<p>En aquesta mateixa posició em trobava quan el vaig cridar, explicant-li ràpidament què volia que fes: revisar un paper petit amb mi. Imagineu la meva sorpresa, millor dit, la meva consternació, quan sense moure&rsquo;s de la seva intimitat, Bartleby va respondre amb una veu singularment suau però ferma: &ldquo;Preferiria no fer-ho.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vaig quedar-me una estona en perfecte silenci, recobrant les facultats atabalades. De seguida se&rsquo;m va acudir que les oïdes m&rsquo;havien enganyat, o que Bartleby havia entès malament el que volia dir. Vaig repetir la petició amb el to més clar que vaig poder adoptar. Però amb igual claredat va arribar la resposta anterior: &ldquo;Preferiria no fer-ho.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Preferiria no fer-ho&rdquo;, vaig repetir-li, aixecant-me molt excitat i travessant l&rsquo;habitació a grans passes. &ldquo;Què voleu dir? Esteu boig de remat? Vull que m&rsquo;ajudeu a comparar aquest full—agafeu-lo&rdquo;, i se&rsquo;l vaig acostar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Preferiria no fer-ho&rdquo;, va dir.</p>
<p>El vaig mirar fixament. Tenia la cara serenament composta; l&rsquo;ull gris, vagament tranquil. Cap arruga d&rsquo;agitació l&rsquo;esquitxava. Si hi hagués hagut el mínim desassossec, ira, impaciència o impertinència en les seves maneres; en altres paraules, si hi hagués hagut res d&rsquo;ordinàriament humà en ell, sens dubte l&rsquo;hauria fet fora violentament del despatx. Però tal com estaven les coses, no m&rsquo;hauria passat més pel cap fer-ho que treure al carrer el meu pàl·lid bust de guix de Ciceró. Em vaig quedar una estona mirant-lo mentre continuava amb la seva escriptura, i després em vaig tornar a seure a la taula. Això és molt estrany, vaig pensar. Què seria millor fer? Però la feina m&rsquo;constrenyia. Vaig decidir oblidar l&rsquo;assumpte de moment i reservar-lo per a un futur d&rsquo;oci. Així doncs, cridant el Nippers de l&rsquo;altra habitació, el paper va ser revisat ràpidament.</p>
<p>Uns quants dies després d&rsquo;això, Bartleby va acabar quatre documents llargs, que eren quadruplicats del testimoniatge d&rsquo;una setmana pres davant meu al meu Tribunal Superior de la Cancelleria. Calia examinar-los. Era un plet important, i la precisió absoluta era imprescindible. Havent-ho disposat tot, vaig cridar el Turkey, el Nippers i el Ginger Nut de l&rsquo;habitació del costat, amb la intenció de posar les quatre còpies a les mans dels meus quatre empleats, mentre jo llegiria des de l&rsquo;original. En conseqüència, el Turkey, el Nippers i el Ginger Nut havien ocupat els seus seients en fila, cadascun amb el seu document a la mà, quan vaig cridar Bartleby perquè s&rsquo;unís a aquest grup interessant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bartleby! De pressa, estic esperant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vaig sentir el lent esgarrapament de les potes de la cadira sobre el terra sense catifa, i aviat va aparèixer dempeus a l&rsquo;entrada del seu ermitatge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Què voleu?&rdquo;, va dir suaument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Les còpies, les còpies&rdquo;, vaig dir precipitadament. &ldquo;Les anirem a examinar. Aquí&rdquo;—i li vaig acostar el quart quadruplicat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Preferiria no fer-ho&rdquo;, va dir, i va desaparèixer suaument darrere del para-vent.</p>
<p>Per uns moments em vaig convertir en una columna de sal, dret al capdavant de la meva filera d&rsquo;empleats asseguts. Recobrant-me, vaig avançar cap al para-vent i vaig exigir el motiu d&rsquo;una conducta tan extraordinària.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Per què us hi resistiu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Preferiria no fer-ho.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amb qualsevol altre home m&rsquo;hauria deixat portar per una còlera terrible, hauria rebutjat qualsevol paraula més i l&rsquo;hauria fet fora ignominiosament del meu despatx. Però hi havia quelcom en Bartleby que no només em desarmava estranyament, sinó que d&rsquo;una manera sorprenent em commovia i em desconcertava. Vaig començar a raonar amb ell.</p>
<p>«Aquests són els vostres propis exemplars que estem a punt d&rsquo;examinar. Us estalvia feina, perquè un sol examen servirà per als vostres quatre papers. És l&rsquo;ús corrent. Tot copista està obligat a ajudar a examinar la seva còpia. No és així? No voleu parlar? Responeu!»</p>
<p>«Prefereixo no fer-ho», va respondre amb un to de flauta. Em va semblar que mentre li parlava, havia considerat acuradament cada afirmació que feia; n&rsquo;havia comprès plenament el significat; no podia refutar les conclusions irrefutables; però, alhora, alguna consideració primordial el portava a respondre com ho feia.</p>
<p>«Esteu decidit, doncs, a no complir amb la meva petició, una petició feta segons l&rsquo;ús corrent i el sentit comú?»</p>
<p>Breument, em va fer entendre que en aquest punt el meu judici era encertat. Sí: la seva decisió era irrevocable.</p>
<p>No és infreqüent que quan un home és intimidat d&rsquo;una manera inèdita i violentament irrazonable, comenci a vacil·lar en les seves creences més evidents. Comença, per dir-ho així, a sospitar vagament que, per meravellós que pugui semblar, tota la justícia i tota la raó estan de l&rsquo;altra banda. En conseqüència, si hi ha presents persones desinteressades, s&rsquo;hi dirigeix per reforçar la seva ment vacil·lant.</p>
<p>«Turkey», vaig dir, «què en penseu d&rsquo;això? No tinc raó?»</p>
<p>«Amb el vostre permís, senyor», va dir Turkey amb el seu to més suau, «crec que la teniu.»</p>
<p>«Nippers», vaig dir, «vós què en penseu?»</p>
<p>«Crec que l&rsquo;hauria d&rsquo;enyegar a puntades del despatx.»</p>
<p>(El lector de percepcions fines notarà aquí que, com que era al matí, la resposta de Turkey s&rsquo;expressa en termes cortesos i tranquils, però Nippers respon de mal humor. O, per repetir una frase anterior, el mal humor de Nippers estava de servei i el de Turkey no.)</p>
<p>«Ginger Nut», vaig dir, disposat a reclutar el sufragi més petit al meu favor, «què en penseu?»</p>
<p>«Crec, senyor, que està una mica boig», va respondre Ginger Nut amb un somriure.</p>
<p>«Sentiu el que diuen», vaig dir, girant-me cap al paravent, «sortiu i compliu el vostre deure.»</p>
<p>Però no es va dignar respondre. Vaig meditar un moment en gran perplexitat. Però els negocis em van apremijar una altra vegada. Vaig decidir posposar de nou la consideració d&rsquo;aquest dilema per al meu temps lliure futur. Amb una mica de treball vam aconseguir examinar els papers sense Bartleby, tot i que a cada pàgina o dues, Turkey deixava caure deferentment la seva opinió que aquest procediment era força inusual; mentre Nippers, retorçant-se a la cadira amb un nerviosisme dispèptic, escopint entre les dents serrades malediccions ocasionals contra l&rsquo;enze tossut darrere del paravent. I per la seva part (la de Nippers), aquesta era la primera i l&rsquo;última vegada que faria la feina d&rsquo;un altre sense cobrar.</p>
<p>Mentrestant, Bartleby romania assegut al seu ermitatge, aliè a tot excepte els seus negocis peculiars.</p>
<p>Passaren alguns dies, durant els quals l&rsquo;escrivent va ser encarregat d&rsquo;una altra feina llarga. La seva conducta estranya em va portar a observar els seus costums amb atenció. Vaig notar que mai no anava a dinar; de fet, que mai no anava enlloc. Per experiència pròpia sabia que mai no havia sortit del meu despatx. Era una sentinella perpètua al seu racó. Però cap a les onze del matí, vaig veure que Gallet s&rsquo;acostava a l&rsquo;obertura del paravent de Bartleby, com si algú l&rsquo;hi cridés amb un gest que jo no podia veure des del meu lloc. El noi sortia llavors del despatx fent sonar unes monedes, i reapareixia amb un grapat de galetes de gingebre que lliurava a l&rsquo;ermitatge, rebent dues galetes per la seva molèstia.</p>
<p>Doncs viu de galetes de gingebre, vaig pensar; mai no dina, pròpiament parlant; deu ser vegetarià, doncs; però no; mai no menja ni tan sols verdures, no menja res més que galetes de gingebre. La meva ment es va endinsar llavors en cavilacions sobre els efectes probables en la constitució humana de viure exclusivament de galetes de gingebre. Les galetes de gingebre es diuen així perquè contenen gingebre com un dels seus components peculiars, i el darrer en sabor. Ara bé, què era el gingebre? Una cosa picant i calenta. Era Bartleby picant i calent? En absolut. El gingebre, doncs, no tenia cap efecte sobre Bartleby.</p>
<p>—Com? No pretendreu pas persistir en aquesta tossuderia absurda?</p>
<p>Cap resposta.</p>
<p>Vaig obrir de bat a bat les portes plegadisses del costat i, en girar-me cap a Turkey i Nippers, vaig exclamar molt agitat: </p>
<p>—Diu, per segona vegada, que no vol examinar els seus papers. Què us sembla, Turkey?</p>
<p>Era la tarda, recordeu-ho. Turkey estava assegut, amb la cara vermella com una caldera de llautó, el cap pelat fumejant, les mans tremolant entre els seus papers tacats.</p>
<p>—Què em sembla? —va rugir Turkey—. Em sembla que me n&rsquo;aniré darrere el seu para-vent i li posaré un ull de gall!</p>
<p>Tot dient això, Turkey es va aixecar i va adoptar una postura de boxejador. S&rsquo;afanyava a complir la seva amenaça quan el vaig aturar, alarmat per haver despertat imprudentment la combativitat de Turkey després de dinar.</p>
<p>—Assegueu-vos, Turkey —vaig dir—, i escolteu què diu Nippers. Què us sembla, Nippers? No estaria justificat acomiadar immediatament en Bartleby?</p>
<p>—Disculpeu, això heu de decidir-ho vós, senyor. Trobo la seva conducta força inusual, i realment injusta envers Turkey i mi. Però potser només és un capritx passatger.</p>
<p>—Ah! —vaig exclamar—. Heu canviat estranyament d&rsquo;opinió, ara en parleu molt dolçament.</p>
<p>—És la cervesa! —va cridar Turkey—. La dolçor són efectes de la cervesa. Nippers i jo hem dinat junts avui. Veieu com sóc de dolç, senyor? He d&rsquo;anar a posar-li un ull de gall?</p>
<p>—Us referiu a en Bartleby, suposo. No, avui no, Turkey —vaig replicar—. Us prego, guardeu els punys.</p>
<p>Cal que ho reconegui? El resultat de tot aquest assumpte va ser que aviat va quedar establert al meu despatx que hi havia un jove copista pàl·lid, de nom Bartleby, amb la seva taula; que em copiava al preu habitual de quatre centaus per foli (cent paraules); però que estava permanentment exempt d&rsquo;examinar la feina que ell mateix feia, tasca que es va transferir a Turkey i Nippers, sens dubte per fer honor a la seva superior perspicàcia; a més, Bartleby no havia de ser enviat mai per cap motiu en el més trivial encàrrec; i que fins i tot si li demanaven que s&rsquo;ocupés d&rsquo;una cosa així, s&rsquo;entenia generalment que preferiria no fer-ho —és a dir, que es negaria rotundament.</p>
<p>Amb el pas dels dies, em vaig avenir força bé amb Bartleby. La seva constància, la seva absència de tota dissipació, la seva laboriositat incansable (excepte quan decidia submergir-se en una contemplació immòbil darrere el seu para-vent), la seva gran quietud, la seva inalterabilitat de comportament en totes les circumstàncies, el convertien en un empleat valuós. Una cosa principal era aquesta: <em>sempre hi era</em>; el primer al matí, contínuament durant el dia, i l&rsquo;últim a la nit. Tenia una confiança singular en la seva honestedat. Sentia que els meus papers més preuats estaven perfectament segurs a les seves mans. Cert que de vegades no podia evitar, per res del món, caure en passions espàsmòdiques sobtades amb ell. Perquè era extremadament difícil tenir sempre presents aquelles estranyes peculiaritats, privilegis i exempcions inaudites que formaven les estipulacions tàcites per part de Bartleby sota les quals romania al meu despatx. De tant en tant, en l&rsquo;afany de despatxar negocis urgents, cridava Bartleby sense voler, amb un to curt i ràpid, per posar-li el dit, per exemple, al nus incipient d&rsquo;un tros de cinta vermella amb què estava lligant uns papers. Naturalment, de darrere el para-vent la resposta habitual, «Prefereixo no fer-ho», era segura; i aleshores, com podia una criatura humana amb les flaqueses comunes de la nostra naturalesa abstenir-se d&rsquo;exclamar amargament davant tanta perversitat, tanta irracionalitat! Tanmateix, cada rebuig addicional d&rsquo;aquest tipus que rebia només tendia a disminuir la probabilitat que repetís la inadvertència.</p>
<p>Doncs bé, un diumenge al matí vaig anar a l&rsquo;església de la Trinitat per sentir un predicador famós, i com que hi havia arribat força d&rsquo;hora, vaig pensar que faria una passejada fins al meu despatx. Per sort duia la clau a sobre; però en ficar-la al pany, vaig trobar que alguna cosa hi feia resistència des de dins. Força sorprès, vaig cridar; i per a la meva consternació es va girar una clau des de l&rsquo;interior; i mostrant-me la seva cara esquifida, i mantenint la porta entrebada, l&rsquo;aparició de Bartleby es va mostrar en mànigues de camisa i, d&rsquo;altra banda, amb la roba estranyament esparracada i en desordre, dient tranquil·lament que ho sentia, però que estava molt ocupat en aquell moment, i —preferia no deixar-me entrar de moment. Amb una paraula o dues de més, va afegir que potser seria millor que donés una volta a la manzana dues o tres vegades, i cap aleshores probablement ja hauria acabat els seus afers.</p>
<p>Doncs bé, l&rsquo;aparició totalment imprevista de Bartleby habitant el meu despatx jurídic un diumenge al matí, amb aquella nonchalance amb aires cadavèrics però senyorials, i alhora ferma i assenyorada, va tenir sobre mi un efecte tan estrany, que de seguida em vaig escabullir de la meva pròpia porta i vaig fer el que em demanava. Però no sense diverses punxades de rebel·lió impotent contra la suau desfacatesa d&rsquo;aquest inexplicable copista. En efecte, era principalment la seva meravellosa suavitat la que no només em va desarmar, sinó que em va humiliar completament, per dir-ho així. Perquè considero que un home, temporalment, queda una mica desvirilitzat quan permet tranquil·lament que el seu empleat li dicti ordres i el faci fora del seu propi local. A més, estava ple d&rsquo;inquietud sobre què podia estar fent Bartleby al meu despatx en mànigues de camisa i, a part d&rsquo;això, en un estat tan desmanegat un diumenge al matí. Passava alguna cosa estranya? No, això era fora de qüestió. No es podia pensar ni per un moment que Bartleby fos una persona immoral. Però què podia estar fent allà? Copiant? Tampoc; fos quina fos la seva excentricitat, Bartleby era una persona eminentment decorosa. Seria l&rsquo;últim home a seure&rsquo;s a la taula en un estat proper a la nuesa. A més, era diumenge; i hi havia alguna cosa en Bartleby que impedia suposar que violaria les propietats del dia amb cap ocupació secular.</p>
<p>Tanmateix, el meu ànim no es va apaivagar; i ple d&rsquo;una curiositat inquieta, finalment vaig tornar a la porta. Sense cap obstacle vaig ficar la clau, la vaig obrir, i vaig entrar. Bartleby no es veia enlloc. Vaig mirar al voltant amb ansietat, vaig espiar darrere el seu biombo; però era evident que se n&rsquo;havia anat. En examinar el lloc més atentament, vaig suposar que durant un període indefinit Bartleby devia menjar, vestir-se i dormir al meu despatx, i això sense plat, mirall o llit. El seient encoixinat d&rsquo;un vell sofà decrèpit en un racó hi tenia la feble empremta d&rsquo;una forma magra i estirada. Enrotllada sota el seu escriptori, vaig trobar una manta; sota la graella buida, una caixa d&rsquo;embetum i una esponja; sobre una cadira, una palangana d&rsquo;estany, amb sabó i una tovallola esparracada; en un diari unes quantes molles de galetes de gingebre i un tros de formatge. Sí, vaig pensar, és prou evident que Bartleby ha estat fent casa aquí, mantenint una llar de solter tot ell sol. Immediatament després el pensament em va travessar com una allau: quina miserable manca d&rsquo;amics i quina solitud es revelen aquí! La seva pobresa és gran; però la seva soledat, que horrible! Imagineu-vos-ho. Un diumenge, Wall Street està deserta com Petra; i cada nit de cada dia és un buit. Aquest edifici també, que els dies feiners bull d&rsquo;activitat i vida, a l&rsquo;hora del capvespre ressona amb pura buidor, i tot el diumenge és desolat. I aquí Bartleby fa casa seva; l&rsquo;únic espectador d&rsquo;una soledat que havia vist plena de gent: una mena de Mari innocent i transformat, meditant entre les ruïnes de Cartago!</p>
<p>Per primera vegada a la meva vida, un sentiment de melancolia aclaparadora i punxant es va apoderar de mi. Abans, mai no havia experimentat res més que una tristesa no del tot desagradable. El vincle d&rsquo;una humanitat comuna em va arrossegar irresistiblement cap a la foscor. Una melancolia fraternal! Perquè tant Bartleby com jo érem fills d&rsquo;Adam. Vaig recordar les sedes brillants i les cares espurnejants que havia vist aquell dia, vestides de gala, navegant com cignes pel Mississippi de Broadway; i les vaig contrastar amb el copista pàl·lid, i vaig pensar: Ah, la felicitat busca la llum, i per això creiem que el món és alegre; però la misèria s&rsquo;amaga lluny, i per això creiem que no hi ha misèria. Aquestes fantasies tristes —quimeres, sens dubte, d&rsquo;un cervell malalt i neci— em van portar a altres pensaments més especials sobre les excentricitats de Bartleby. Pressentiments d&rsquo;estranyes descobertes em rondaven. La forma pàl·lida de l&rsquo;escrivent se&rsquo;m va aparèixer estesa, entre estranys indiferents, en el seu mortalla tremolosa.</p>
<p>De sobte em va cridar l&rsquo;atenció l&rsquo;escriptori tancat de Bartleby, amb la clau a la vista, deixada al pany.</p>
<p>No vull fer cap mal, no busco satisfer cap curiositat morbosa, vaig pensar. A més, l&rsquo;escriptori és meu, i també el que conté, així que hi vaig mirar. Tot estava ordenat metòdicament, els papers col·locats amb pulcritud. Els compartiments eren profunds. Vaig treure els expedients de documents i vaig tantejar en els racons. Aleshores vaig trobar alguna cosa i la vaig treure. Era un mocador de cotó estampat vell, pesat i nuós. El vaig obrir i vaig veure que era una llibreta d&rsquo;estalvis.</p>
<p>Llavors vaig recordar tots els misteris que havia observat en aquell home. Mai no parlava si no era per respondre. Tot i tenir a intervals temps considerable per a ell mateix, mai no l&rsquo;havia vist llegint —ni tan sols un diari. Durant llargs períodes es quedava dret mirant cap enfora, per la seva pàl·lida finestra darrere del paravent, contemplant la paret morta de totxo. Estava ben segur que mai no visitava cap restaurant. La seva cara pàl·lida indicava clarament que mai no bevia cervesa com Turkey, o ni tan sols te i cafè, com els altres homes. Mai no anava a cap lloc concret que jo pogués saber. Mai no sortia a passejar, llevat que aquest fos el cas en aquell moment. S&rsquo;havia negat a dir qui era, d&rsquo;on venia, o si tenia cap parent al món. Tot i ser tan prim i pàl·lid, mai no es queixava de mala salut. I més que tot, vaig recordar un cert aire inconscient de pàl·lida —com ho diria?— de pàl·lida altivesa, diguem-ne, o més aviat una reserva austera sobre ell, que m&rsquo;havia impressionat positivament fins a fer-me obedient respecte a les seves excentricitats, quan havia tingut por de demanar-li la cosa més insignificant, tot i que podia saber, per la seva immobilitat prolongada, que darrere el seu para-vent devia estar dret en un d&rsquo;aquells seus somnis davant la paret morta.</p>
<p>Pensava en tot això: com havia convertit el meu despatx en casa seva, el seu estat d&rsquo;ànim sombriu, la seva tristesa constant. Mentre hi donava voltes, una sensació de prudència em va envair. Al principi havia sentit pura melancolia i sincera compassió; però a mesura que la desolació de Bartleby creixia en la meva imaginació, aquella melancolia es convertia en por, i la compassió, en rebuig.</p>
<p>És cert i terrible alhora: fins a cert punt, la vista del sofriment desperta els nostres millors sentiments. Però en alguns casos, quan es passa d&rsquo;aquest punt, ja no. S&rsquo;equivoquen els qui diuen que això passa sempre per l&rsquo;egoisme del cor humà. No: ve més aviat de la desesperança de no poder remeiar un mal excessiu i orgànic. Per a una persona sensible, la compassió sovint és dolor. I quan t&rsquo;adones que aquesta compassió no pot portar a cap ajuda real, el seny t&rsquo;aconsella desfer-te&rsquo;n.</p>
<p>El que vaig veure aquell matí em va convèncer que el copista patia un trastorn innat i incurable. Podia donar almoines al seu cos, però el seu cos no li feia mal. Era l&rsquo;ànima que patia, i l&rsquo;ànima no la podia tocar.</p>
<p>No vaig anar a Trinity Church aquell matí. D&rsquo;alguna manera, el que havia vist m&rsquo;ho impedia. Vaig caminar cap a casa pensant què faria amb Bartleby. Al final vaig decidir&hellip;</p>
<p>—Quina és la teva resposta, Bartleby? —vaig dir, després d&rsquo;esperar un temps considerable una rèplica. Durant tot aquest temps, el seu rostre va romandre immòbil, llevat d&rsquo;un tremolor gairebé imperceptible als llavis blancs i afilats.</p>
<p>—De moment, prefereixo no donar cap resposta —va dir, i es va retirar al seu ermitori.</p>
<p>Era dèbil de la meva part, ho confesso, però els seus modals en aquesta ocasió em van irritar. No només semblava amagar-s&rsquo;hi un cert desdeny serè, sinó que la seva perversitat em va semblar ingrata, considerant el bon tracte i la indulgència innegables que havia rebut de mi.</p>
<p>Vaig tornar a seure, pensant què havia de fer. Per mortificat que estigués pel seu comportament, i per resolt que fos a acomiadar-lo quan vaig entrar al despatx, tot i així vaig sentir estranyament quelcom supersticiós que em removia el cor, impedint-me dur a terme el meu propòsit i denunciant-me com un bergant si gosava pronunciar una sola paraula amarga contra aquest el més desampatat dels homes. Finalment, apropant amb familiaritat la cadira darrere la seva mampara, m&rsquo;hi vaig asseure i vaig dir: </p>
<p>—Bartleby, no et preocupis doncs per revelar la teva història; però deixa que et supliqui, com un amic, que et conformis tant com sigui possible als usos d&rsquo;aquest despatx. Digues ara que ajudaràs a examinar papers demà o demà passat: en resum, digues ara que d&rsquo;aquí a un dia o dos començaràs a ser una mica raonable&hellip; digues-ho, Bartleby.</p>
<p>—De moment, preferiria no ser una mica raonable —va ser la seva resposta, suaument cadavèrica.</p>
<p>Just aleshores es van obrir les portes plegables, i Nippers s&rsquo;hi va apropar. Semblava patir d&rsquo;una nit de descans inusualment dolenta, causada per una indigestió més severa que l&rsquo;habitual. Va sentir les paraules finals de Bartleby.</p>
<p>—Preferiria que em deixessin tranquil aquí —va dir Bartleby, com si l&rsquo;ofengués que el molestessin en la seva solitud.</p>
<p>—Aquesta és la paraula, Turkey —vaig dir jo—, aquesta.</p>
<p>—Ah, <em>preferir</em>? Ah, sí, paraula estranya. Jo mai no la faig servir. Però, senyor, com deia, si ell ho preferís&hellip;</p>
<p>—Turkey —vaig interrompre—, si us plau, retireu-vos.</p>
<p>—Oh, certament, senyor, si ho preferiu.</p>
<p>Quan va obrir la porta plegable per retirar-se, Nippers, des del seu escriptori, va fer un cop d&rsquo;ull i va preguntar si preferia que copiés un cert document en paper blau o blanc. No va emfasitzar gens la paraula preferir amb to burlesc. Era evident que li havia sortit sense voler. Vaig pensar: sens dubte m&rsquo;he de desfer d&rsquo;un home que ha perdut el seny, que ja ha aconseguit confondre, si no els caps, almenys les paraules meves i dels meus empleats. Però vaig creure prudent no fer-lo fora de seguida.</p>
<p>L&rsquo;endemà vaig veure que Bartleby no feia res més que estar-se dret davant la finestra, mirant el mur sense vida. Quan li vaig preguntar per què no escrivia, va dir que havia decidit no escriure més.</p>
<p>—Com? Què dieu? —vaig exclamar—. No escriure més?</p>
<p>—No més.</p>
<p>—I per què?</p>
<p>—No ho veieu vós mateix? —va respondre amb indiferència.</p>
<p>El vaig mirar fixament i vaig veure que tenia els ulls apagats i vidriosos. De seguida se&rsquo;m va ocórrer que la seva dedicació extraordinària copiant davant aquella finestra fosca durant les primeres setmanes de la seva estada amb mi podria haver-li perjudicat temporalment la visió.</p>
<p>Va romandre com sempre, una figura permanent al meu despatx. Més encara—si això fos possible—es va convertir en una presència encara més arrelada que abans. Què es podia fer? No faria res a l&rsquo;oficina: per què havia de quedar-se allà? En poques paraules, s&rsquo;havia convertit en una llosa per a mi, no només inútil, sinó molesta de suportar. Però em feia pena. Dic menys que la veritat quan afirmo que, per ell mateix, em causava inquietud. Si tan sols hagués esmentat un sol parent o amic, immediatament hauria escrit, i els hauria instat a endur-se el pobre noi a algun retir convenient. Però semblava sol, absolutament sol a l&rsquo;univers. Un fragment de naufragi enmig de l&rsquo;Atlàntic. Finalment, les necessitats dels meus negocis es van imposar sobre totes les altres consideracions. Tan decorosament com vaig poder, vaig dir a Bartleby que en sis dies havia d&rsquo;abandonar l&rsquo;oficina sense condicions. El vaig avisar que prengués mesures, en l&rsquo;interval, per trobar algun altre allotjament. Em vaig oferir a ajudar-lo en aquest esforç, si ell mateix donava el primer pas cap al trasllat. &ldquo;I quan finalment em deixis, Bartleby&rdquo;, vaig afegir, &ldquo;em cuidaré que no te&rsquo;n vagis del tot desvalgut. D&rsquo;aquí a sis dies a partir d&rsquo;ara, recorda-ho.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mentre tornava cap a casa amb aire pensarós, la vanitat va vèncer la compassió. No podia deixar d&rsquo;enorgullir-me molt de la mestrívola gestió amb què m&rsquo;havia desfet de Bartleby. Mestrívola l&rsquo;anomeno, i tal ha d&rsquo;aparèixer a qualsevol pensador desapassionat. La bellesa del meu procediment semblava residir en la seva perfecta quietud. No hi havia intimidacions ni bravuconades de cap mena, ni cridòria colèrica, ni passejar amunt i avall pel despatx llançant ordres vehements perquè Bartleby recollís els seus trastos miserables. Res d&rsquo;això. Sense ordenar a veu en coll que Bartleby se n&rsquo;anés —com hauria fet un geni inferior—, jo havia <em>assumit</em> que marxar era inevitable. I sobre aquesta premissa havia construït tot el que tenia a dir. Com més pensava en el meu procediment, més m&rsquo;encantava. Tanmateix, l&rsquo;endemà al matí, en despertar-me, em van sorgir dubtes. D&rsquo;alguna manera havia dormit els fums de la vanitat. Els moments de més claredat d&rsquo;un home són just després de despertar-se al matí. El meu procediment em semblava tan sagaç com sempre, però només en teoria. Com resultaria en la pràctica? Aquí raïa el problema. Havia estat realment un pensament bell suposar la partida de Bartleby, però, al cap i a la fi, aquesta premissa era simplement meva i gens de Bartleby. El punt clau no era si jo havia pressuposat que em deixaria, sinó si ell preferiria fer-ho. Era més aviat un home que es guiava per preferències que per suposicions.</p>
<p>Després d&rsquo;esmorzar, vaig caminar cap al centre, sopesant les probabilitats a favor i en contra. Un moment pensava que seria un fracàs miserable, i que Bartleby es trobaria viu com sempre al meu despatx; al moment següent semblava cert que trobaria la seva cadira buida. I així anava vacil·lant. A la cantonada de Broadway i Canal Street, vaig veure un grup força animat de gent xerrant amb seriositat.</p>
<p>«Aposto que no ho fa», va dir una veu quan passava.</p>
<p>«Que no se&rsquo;n va? Fet!», vaig dir jo, «aposteu els vostres diners.»</p>
<p>Estava posant la mà a la butxaca instintivament per treure els meus, quan vaig recordar que era dia d&rsquo;eleccions. Les paraules que havia sentit no feien referència a Bartleby, sinó a l&rsquo;èxit o fracàs d&rsquo;algun candidat a l&rsquo;alcaldia. En el meu estat d&rsquo;ànim concentrat, m&rsquo;havia imaginat, per dir-ho així, que tot Broadway compartia la meva excitació i debatia la mateixa qüestió que jo. Vaig continuar, molt agraït que l&rsquo;enrenou del carrer amagués la meva momentània distracció.</p>
<p>Com tenia previst, vaig arribar més d&rsquo;hora que de costum a la porta del meu despatx. Vaig quedar-me escoltant un moment. Tot era silenci. Devia haver marxat. Vaig provar el pom. La porta estava tancada amb clau. Sí, el meu procediment havia funcionat com un encís; efectivament, havia desaparegut. Però una certa melancolia es barrejava amb això: gairebé em sabia greu pel meu èxit brillant. Estava a punt de buscar la clau sota l&rsquo;estora, on Bartleby havia de deixar-la per a mi, quan accidentalment el meu genoll va tocar un panell, produint un so de crida, i en resposta una veu em va arribar des de l&rsquo;interior: «Encara no; estic ocupat.»</p>
<p>Era Bartleby.</p>
<p>Vaig quedar-me de pedra. Per un instant vaig romandre dret com aquell home que, amb la pipa a la boca, va morir una tarda sense núvols fa molt temps a Virgínia, fulminat per un llamp d&rsquo;estiu; el van matar a la seva pròpia finestra oberta i càlida, i va romandre allí recolzat contemplant la tarda somniosa, fins que algú el va tocar i va caure.</p>
<p>Ara em trobava en tal estat de ressentiment nerviós que vaig considerar prudent contenir-me, de moment, de fer més demostracions. Bartleby i jo érem sols. Vaig recordar la tragèdia del desgraciat Adams i el més desgraciat encara Colt al despatx solitari d&rsquo;aquest darrer. Vaig pensar com el pobre Colt, terriblement irritat per Adams, es va deixar arrossegar per l&rsquo;ira i, sense adonar-se&rsquo;n, va cometre aquell acte fatal. Un acte que certament ningú no podia deplorar més que ell mateix.</p>
<p>Sovint, reflexionant sobre el tema, se m&rsquo;havia ocorregut que si aquella baralla hagués tingut lloc al carrer o en una casa particular, no hauria acabat com va acabar. Va ser el fet d&rsquo;estar sols en un despatx solitari, al pis superior d&rsquo;un edifici mancat de qualsevol calidesa domèstica. Un despatx sense catifes, sens dubte, d&rsquo;aspecte polsós i desolat. Això fou el que va intensificar la desesperació irritable del desgraciat Colt.</p>
<p>Però quan aquest vell Adam del ressentiment va despertar-se en mi i em va temptar respecte a Bartleby, vaig lluitar amb ell i el vaig vèncer. Com? Simplement recordant la divina injunció: «Un nou manament us dono: que us estimeu els uns als altres.» Sí, això va ser el que em va salvar. Deixant de banda consideracions més elevades, la caritat sovint opera com un principi vastament savi i prudent: una gran salvaguarda per al seu posseïdor. Els homes han comès assassinats per gelosia, per ràbia, per odi, per egoisme i per orgull espiritual; però cap home que jo sàpiga ha comès mai un assassinat diabòlic per la dolça caritat. El simple interès propi, doncs, si no es pot allistar cap motiu millor, hauria d&rsquo;impulsar tots els éssers, especialment els d&rsquo;esperit ardent, a la caritat i la filantropia. En tot cas, en l&rsquo;ocasió en qüestió, em vaig esforçar a ofegar els meus sentiments exasperats cap a l&rsquo;escrivent interpretant benèvolament la seva conducta. Pobre home, pobre home!, vaig pensar, no vol fer cap mal; i a més, ha passat moments difícils, i cal tenir-li paciència.</p>
<p>Passaren alguns dies durant els quals, en moments d&rsquo;oci, vaig llegir una mica l&rsquo;obra d&rsquo;Edwards sobre la voluntat i la de Priestley sobre la necessitat. En aquelles circumstàncies, aquests llibres em van produir una sensació saludable. Poc a poc em vaig anar convencent que aquests meus problemes amb el copista havien estat tots predestinats des de l&rsquo;eternitat, i que Bartleby m&rsquo;havia estat assignat per algun propòsit misteriós d&rsquo;una Providència sàvia del tot, que no corresponia a un simple mortal com jo comprendre. Sí, Bartleby, queda&rsquo;t darrere del teu paravent, vaig pensar; ja no et perseguiré més; ets innocu i silenciós com qualsevol d&rsquo;aquestes cadires velles; en resum, mai no em sento tan tranquil com quan sé que ets aquí. Finalment, ho veig, ho sento; entenc el propòsit predestinat de la meva vida. Estic content. Altres potser tinguin papers més importants a representar; però la meva missió en aquest món, Bartleby, és donar-te espai d&rsquo;oficina durant el temps que creguis convenient quedar-t&rsquo;hi.</p>
<p>Crec que aquest estat d&rsquo;ànim savi i feliç hauria continuat en mi, de no ser pels comentaris no sol·licitats i sense caritat que em van imposar els meus amics professionals que visitaven les oficines. Però així passa sovint, que la fricció constant d&rsquo;esperits petits acaba gastant les millors resolucions dels més generosos. Encara que, cal reconèixer-ho, quan hi reflexionava, no era estrany que la gent que entrava a la meva oficina quedés impressionada per l&rsquo;aspecte peculiar de l&rsquo;inexplicable Bartleby, i sentís la temptació de fer observacions sinistres sobre ell. De vegades un advocat que tenia afers amb mi, venint al meu despatx i no trobant ningú més que l&rsquo;escrivent, intentava obtenir algun tipus d&rsquo;informació precisa sobre el meu parador; però sense fer cas de la seva xerrameca inútil, Bartleby romandria dret, immòbil al mig de l&rsquo;habitació. Així, després de contemplar-lo en aquella posició durant una estona, l&rsquo;advocat se n&rsquo;anava, no pas més savi que quan havia vingut.</p>
<p>A més, quan se celebrava una sessió judicial i la sala s&rsquo;omplia d&rsquo;advocats i testimonis amb els negocis a tot gas, algun col·lega molt ocupat, en veure Bartleby completament inactiu, li demanava que anés al seu despatx a buscar-li uns documents. Aleshores, Bartleby declinava tranquilament l&rsquo;encàrrec, però continuava ociós com abans. L&rsquo;advocat el mirava fixament, estupefacte, i es girava cap a mi. I què podia dir-hi?</p>
<p>Finalment vaig adonar-me que per tot el cercle de les meves relacions professionals circulava un murmuri d&rsquo;estranyesa sobre l&rsquo;estranya criatura que tenia al despatx. Això em preocupava molt. I quan se&rsquo;m va acudir la idea que potser seria un home longeu que continuaria ocupant el meu despatx i desafiant la meva autoritat, desconcertant els visitants, escandalitzant la meva reputació professional, escampant una tristor general per les dependències, sobrevivint fins al final amb els seus estalvis —perquè sens dubte no gastava més de deu cèntims al dia—, i que al final potser em sobreviuria i reclamaria la propietat del despatx en virtut del seu dret d&rsquo;ocupació perpètua&hellip; Mentre totes aquestes fosques anticipacions s&rsquo;acumulaven sobre mi cada vegada més, i els amics m&rsquo;importunaven contínuament amb comentaris implacables sobre l&rsquo;aparició que tenia al despatx, es va produir un gran canvi en mi. Vaig decidir aplegar totes les facultats i desfer-me per sempre d&rsquo;aquest pes insuportable.</p>
<p>Tot i això, abans de tramar cap projecte complicat adaptat a aquest propòsit, primer simplement vaig suggerir a Bartleby la conveniència de la seva marxa permanent. En un to calmat i seriós, vaig recomanar la idea a la seva consideració acurada i madura. Però, havent-hi meditat tres dies, em va comunicar que la seva determinació original seguia igual; en resum, que encara preferia quedar-se amb mi.</p>
<p>Calia fer quelcom sever, quelcom inusual. Però què! No el fareu arrestar per un algutzir, oi que no? No lliurareu aquella pal·lidesa innocent a la presó comuna? I amb quins fonaments podríeu fer tal cosa? Un captaire, dieu? Ell un captaire, un rodamón que es nega a moure&rsquo;s? Precisament perquè no vol ser un captaire el voleu considerar com a tal. És massa absurd. Sense mitjans visibles de subsistència: aquí el teniu. Errat de nou: és evident que es manté per si mateix, i aquesta és l&rsquo;única prova irrefutable que qualsevol home pot donar de tenir els mitjans per fer-ho. Prou, doncs. Ja que no em vol deixar, l&rsquo;he de deixar jo a ell. Canviaré de despatx, em traslladaré a un altre lloc. Li faré saber clarament que si el trobo als meus nous locals procediré contra ell com un simple intrús.</p>
<p>Així, doncs, l&rsquo;endemà li vaig dir: «Aquest despatx és massa lluny de l&rsquo;Ajuntament; l&rsquo;aire és malsà. En una paraula, proposo traslladar els meus locals la setmana vinent. Ja no necessitaré els vostres serveis. Us ho dic ara perquè pugueu cercar un altre lloc.»</p>
<p>No va respondre. No es va dir res més.</p>
<p>El dia convingut vaig contractar carros i homes, vaig anar al meu despatx i, com que tenia pocs mobles, tot va ser tret en poques hores. Durant tot el temps, el copista va romandre dret darrere el paravent, que vaig ordenar retirar al final. El van treure i, plegat com un voluminós infoli, el va retirar; i, plegat com un voluminós infoli, el va deixar com a ocupant immòbil d&rsquo;una habitació despullada. Em vaig quedar a l&rsquo;entrada mirant-lo un moment, mentre alguna cosa dins meu em retreia.</p>
<p>Vaig tornar a entrar, amb la mà a la butxaca i el cor a la boca.</p>
<p>«Adéu, Bartleby; me&rsquo;n vaig&hellip; adéu, i que Déu et beneeixi d&rsquo;alguna manera; i pren això», lliscant alguna cosa a la seva mà. Però va caure a terra, i llavors, estranyament, em vaig arrencar d&rsquo;ell, de qui tant havia desitjat desfer-me.</p>
<p>Instal·lat als meus nous locals, durant un dia o dos vaig mantenir la porta tancada amb clau, i m&rsquo;espantava amb cada petjada als passadissos. Quan tornava a les meves habitacions després de qualsevol absència breu, em parava un instant al llindar i escoltava atentament abans d&rsquo;aplicar la clau. Però aquests temors eren innecessaris. Bartleby mai no es va acostar a mi.</p>
<p>Pensava que tot anava bé, quan un desconegut d&rsquo;aspecte pertorbat em va visitar, preguntant si jo era la persona que havia ocupat recentment les habitacions del número&hellip; de Wall Street.</p>
<p>Ple de pressentiments, vaig respondre que sí.</p>
<p>«Doncs, senyor», va dir el desconegut, que resultà ser un advocat, «vós sou responsable de l&rsquo;home que hi vau deixar. Es nega a fer cap còpia; es nega a fer res; diu que prefereix no fer-ho; i es nega a abandonar el local.»</p>
<p>«Ho sento molt, senyor», vaig dir jo, amb tranquil·litat fingida, però un tremolor intern, «però, realment, l&rsquo;home al qual us referiu no és res meu: no és cap parent ni aprenent meu, perquè m&rsquo;hagueu de fer responsable d&rsquo;ell.»</p>
<p>«Per l&rsquo;amor de Déu, qui és?»</p>
<p>—Certament no puc informar-vos. No sé res d&rsquo;ell. Abans el tenia contractat com a copista, però ja fa temps que no ha fet res per a mi.</p>
<p>—Doncs ja me&rsquo;n cuidaré jo —bon dia, senyor.</p>
<p>Passaren diversos dies, i no en vaig saber res més; i tot i que sovint sentia un impuls caritós d&rsquo;anar al lloc i veure el pobre Bartleby, una mena de reticència em retenia.</p>
<p>Ja tot s&rsquo;ha acabat per a ell, pensava finalment, quan després d&rsquo;una altra setmana no em va arribar cap nova informació. Però quan vaig arribar al despatx l&rsquo;endemà, vaig trobar diverses persones esperant a la meva porta en un estat d&rsquo;excitació nerviosa considerable.</p>
<p>—Aquest és l&rsquo;home —aquí ve —va cridar el que anava al davant, que vaig reconèixer com l&rsquo;advocat que m&rsquo;havia visitat abans a soles.</p>
<p>—Se l&rsquo;ha d&rsquo;endur, senyor, immediatament —va cridar una persona corpulenta entre ells, avançant cap a mi, i que sabia que era el propietari del núm. — de Wall Street—. Aquests senyors, els meus inquilins, no ho poden suportar més; el senyor B— —assenyalant l&rsquo;advocat— l&rsquo;ha fet fora de la seva habitació, i ara s&rsquo;entesta a vagarejar per tot l&rsquo;edifici, assegut a la barana de l&rsquo;escala durant el dia, i dormint a l&rsquo;entrada durant la nit. Tothom està preocupat; els clients abandonen els despatxos; hi ha por que es formi un avalot; heu de fer alguna cosa, i sense dilació.</p>
<p>Estuporat per aquest torrent, vaig recular, i hauria volgut tancar-me a les meves noves dependències. Debades vaig insistir que Bartleby no tenia res a veure amb mi —no més que amb qualsevol altre. Debades: jo era l&rsquo;última persona coneguda que havia tingut alguna cosa a veure amb ell, i em feien responsable d&rsquo;aquest terrible assumpte. Tement llavors ser exposat als diaris (com un dels presents va amenaçar obscurament), vaig considerar l&rsquo;afer i finalment vaig dir que, si l&rsquo;advocat em donava una entrevista confidencial amb l&rsquo;escrivent, al seu propi despatx, aquella tarda faria el possible per alliberar-los de la molèstia de què es queixaven.</p>
<p>Pujant les escales cap al meu antic refugi, allà era Bartleby assegut silenciosament a la barana del replà.</p>
<p>«Què fas aquí, Bartleby?», vaig dir.</p>
<p>«Assegut a la barana», va respondre suaument.</p>
<p>El vaig fer entrar al despatx de l&rsquo;advocat, que llavors ens va deixar sols.</p>
<p>«Bartleby», vaig dir, «ets conscient que em causes una gran tribulació, persistint a ocupar l&rsquo;entrada després d&rsquo;haver estat acomiadat del despatx?»</p>
<p>Cap resposta.</p>
<p>«Ara ha de passar una de dues coses. O has de fer alguna cosa, o se t&rsquo;ha de fer alguna cosa. Ara, en quin tipus de negoci t&rsquo;agradaria dedicar-te? T&rsquo;agradaria tornar a copiar per a algú?»</p>
<p>«No; preferiria no fer cap canvi.»</p>
<p>«T&rsquo;agradaria una feina de dependent en una botiga de teles?»</p>
<p>«Hi ha massa confinament en això. No, no m&rsquo;agradaria ser dependent; però no sóc especialment exigent.»</p>
<p>«Massa confinament!», vaig exclamar, «però si tu mateix et mantens confinat tot el temps!»</p>
<p>«Preferiria no acceptar una feina de dependent», va replicar, com per tancar aquest petit punt d&rsquo;una vegada.</p>
<p>—Què et semblaria fer de taver? Així no forçaries la vista.</p>
<p>—No m&rsquo;agradaria gens; però, com he dit abans, no sóc especialment exigent.</p>
<p>Aquesta locuacitat inusual em va encoratjar. Vaig tornar a la càrrega.</p>
<p>—Doncs bé, t&rsquo;agradaria viatjar pel país cobrant factures per als comerciants? Això milloraria la teva salut.</p>
<p>—No, preferiria fer alguna altra cosa.</p>
<p>—I què et semblaria anar d&rsquo;acompanyant a Europa, per entretenir algun jove gentilhome amb la teva conversa? Què et sembla?</p>
<p>—Gens. No em sembla que hi hagi res de definitiu en tot això. M&rsquo;agrada ser sedentari. Però no sóc especialment exigent.</p>
<p>—Sedentari seràs, doncs —vaig cridar, perdent ja tota la paciència, i per primera vegada en tota aquesta connexió exasperant amb ell, deixant-me endur veritablement per la còlera—. Si no te&rsquo;n vas d&rsquo;aquest local abans de la nit, em sentiré obligat —de fet, <em>estic</em> obligat— a&hellip; a&hellip; a marxar-me&rsquo;n jo mateix! —vaig concloure de manera bastant absurda, no sabent amb quina amenaça possible intentar espantar la seva immobilitat perquè cedís. Desesperat de tot esforç ulterior, me n&rsquo;anava precipitadament quan se&rsquo;m va acudir un pensament final, un que no havia estat del tot rebutjat abans.</p>
<p>—Bartleby —vaig dir, amb el to més amable que vaig poder adoptar en circumstàncies tan excitants—, vindràs a casa meva ara? No al meu despatx, sinó al meu domicili, i t&rsquo;hi quedaràs fins que puguem decidir algun arranjament convenient per a tu quan tinguem temps? Vine, marxem ara mateix, immediatament.</p>
<p>—No: de moment, preferiria no fer cap canvi.</p>
<p>No vaig respondre res; però esquivant efectivament tothom amb la sobtanetat i rapidesa de la meva fugida, vaig sortir corrents de l&rsquo;edifici, vaig pujar Wall Street cap a Broadway corrent, i saltant al primer òmnibus aviat em vaig veure fora de tot perill de persecució. Tan bon punt va tornar la tranquil·litat, vaig percebre clarament que ja havia fet tot el que possiblement podia, tant pel que fa a les exigències del propietari i els seus llogaters, com respecte al meu propi desig i sentit del deure, per beneficiar Bartleby i protegir-lo de persecucions grolleres. Ara vaig esforçar-me a estar completament despreocupat i tranquil; i la meva consciència em justificava en aquest intent, encara que de fet no va ser tan reeixit com hauria volgut. Tan temorós estava de ser novament caçat pel propietari indignat i els seus llogaters exasperats, que, deixant els meus negocis a Nippers, durant uns quants dies vaig córrer amunt i avall per la part alta de la ciutat i pels suburbis, en el meu rockaway; vaig creuar fins a Jersey City i Hoboken, i vaig fer visites furtives a Manhattanville i Astoria. De fet, gairebé vaig viure en el meu rockaway durant aquell temps.</p>
<p>Quan vaig entrar de nou al meu despatx, hi havia una nota del propietari sobre l&rsquo;escriptori. La vaig obrir amb les mans tremoloses. M&rsquo;informava que havia avisat la policia i havia fet treure Bartleby i portar-lo a les Tombes com a rodamón. A més, com que jo en sabia més que ningú altre sobre ell, desitjava que anés a aquell lloc per fer una declaració adequada dels fets. Aquestes noves van tenir un efecte contradictori en mi. Al principi vaig sentir indignació; però al final gairebé ho vaig aprovar. La disposició enèrgica i expeditiva del propietari l&rsquo;havia portat a adoptar un procediment que no crec que jo hagués decidit per mi mateix; i, tanmateix, com a últim recurs, en circumstàncies tan peculiars, semblava l&rsquo;únic pla possible.</p>
<p>Com vaig saber després, el pobre copista, quan li van dir que havia de ser conduït a les Tombes, no va oferir ni el més mínim obstacle, sinó que, a la seva manera pàl·lida i immutable, va assentir silenciosament.</p>
<p>Alguns dels espectadors compassius i curiosos es van unir a la comitiva; i encapçalada per un dels gendarmes braç amb braç amb Bartleby, la processó silenciosa va obrir-se pas a través de tot el soroll, i la calor, i l&rsquo;alegria dels carrers bulliciosos de migdia.</p>
<p>El mateix dia que vaig rebre la nota vaig anar a les Tombes, o per parlar amb més propietat, a les Sales de Justícia. Cercant el funcionari apropiat, vaig explicar el motiu de la meva visita, i se&rsquo;m va informar que l&rsquo;individu que jo descrivia era efectivament allà dins. Aleshores vaig assegurar al funcionari que Bartleby era un home perfectament honest, i molt digne de compassió, per molt inexplicablement excèntric que fos. Vaig narrar tot el que sabia i vaig concloure suggerint la idea de deixar-lo en un confinament tan indulgent com fos possible fins que es pogués fer alguna cosa menys dura; tot i que en veritat no sabia què. En tot cas, si no es podia decidir res més, l&rsquo;hospici l&rsquo;hauria d&rsquo;acollir. Llavors vaig demanar tenir una entrevista.</p>
<p>Com que no estava sota cap càrrec deshonrós, i era força serè i innocu en tots els seus actes, li havien permès vagarejar lliurement per la presó, i especialment pel pati herbós tancat. I així el vaig trobar, dret tot sol al més silenciós dels patis, la cara girada cap a un mur alt, mentre al voltant, des de les estretes escletxes de les finestres de la presó, em semblava veure mirar-lo els ulls d&rsquo;assassins i lladres.</p>
<p>«Bartleby!»</p>
<p>«Et conec», va dir, sense girar-se, «i no vull dir-te res.»</p>
<p>«No he estat jo qui t&rsquo;ha portat aquí, Bartleby», vaig dir, profundament dolgut per la seva sospita implícita. «I per a tu, aquest no hauria de ser un lloc tan vil. No hi ha res de reprensible en tu per ser aquí. I mira, no és un lloc tan trist com hom podria pensar. Mira, aquí hi ha el cel, i aquí hi ha l&rsquo;herba.»</p>
<p>«Sé on sóc», va respondre, però no va dir res més, i el vaig deixar.</p>
<p>Quan vaig tornar a entrar al passadís, un home ample i de carn, amb un davantal, em va abordar, i assenyalant amb el polze per sobre l&rsquo;espatlla va dir: «És el vostre amic?»</p>
<p>«Sí.»</p>
<p>«Vol morir-se de gana? Si és així, que visqui de la dieta de la presó, i prou.»</p>
<p>—Qui és vostè? —vaig preguntar, sense saber què fer amb una persona que parlava tan poc oficialment en un lloc així.</p>
<p>—Sóc el cantiner. Els senyors que tenen amics aquí em contracten perquè els porti alguna cosa bona per menjar.</p>
<p>—És veritat? —vaig dir, girant-me cap al carceller.</p>
<p>Va dir que sí.</p>
<p>—Doncs bé —vaig dir, lliscant unes monedes de plata a les mans del cantiner (perquè així l&rsquo;anomenaven)—. Vull que es cuidi especialment del meu amic d&rsquo;allà; que tingui el millor dinar que pugui aconseguir. I ha de ser-hi tan cortès com sigui possible.</p>
<p>—Em presentarà? —va dir el cantiner, mirant-me amb una expressió que semblava voler dir que estava impacient per tenir l&rsquo;oportunitat de donar mostres de la seva educació.</p>
<p>Pensant que seria beneficiós per al copista, vaig accedir; i després de preguntar-li el nom al cantiner, vaig pujar amb ell fins a Bartleby.</p>
<p>—Bartleby, aquest és en Costes; el trobarà molt útil.</p>
<p>—Servidor seu, senyor, servidor seu —va dir el cantiner, fent una reverència profunda darrere del seu davantal—. Espero que li agradi estar aquí, senyor; jardins amplis, cel·les fresques, senyor; espero que es quedi amb nosaltres una temporada; procurarem que li sigui agradable. La senyora Costes i jo tindríem el plaer de tenir-lo a dinar, senyor, a l&rsquo;habitació privada de la senyora Costes?</p>
<p>—Prefereixo no dinar avui —va dir Bartleby, girant-se—. Em faria mal; no estic acostumat als dinars. —Dient això, es va moure lentament cap a l&rsquo;altre costat del recinte i va prendre posició davant del mur cec.</p>
<p>—Què passa aquí? —va dir el cantiner, mirant-me amb ulls d&rsquo;estranyesa—. És estrany, oi que sí?</p>
<p>«Crec que està una mica trastornat», vaig dir amb tristesa.</p>
<p>«Trastornat? Ho dieu? Bé, paraula meva, pensava que el vostre amic era un falsificador de lletres; sempre són pàl·lids i distingits, aquests falsificadors. No els puc compadir&hellip; no hi puc fer res, senyor. Coneixíeu en Monroe Edwards?», va afegir amb to commovedor, i va fer una pausa. Després, posant-me la mà compassivament a l&rsquo;espatlla, va sospirar: «Va morir de tuberculosi a Sing-Sing. Així que no coneixíeu en Monroe?»</p>
<p>«No, mai no he tingut tracte social amb cap falsificador. Però no puc quedar-me més. Vigileu el meu amic d&rsquo;allà. No hi perdreu. Ja ens tornarem a veure.»</p>
<p>Uns quants dies després, vaig tornar a aconseguir accés a les Tombes i vaig recórrer els passadissos buscant Bartleby; però sense trobar-lo.</p>
<p>«El vaig veure sortir de la seva cel·la fa poc», va dir un carceller, «potser ha anat a passejar pel pati.»</p>
<p>Així que vaig anar en aquella direcció.</p>
<p>«Busqueu l&rsquo;home silenciós?», va dir un altre carceller en creuar-nos. «Allà jau, dormint al pati. No fa ni vint minuts que l&rsquo;he vist ajeure&rsquo;s.»</p>
<p>El pati era completament silenciós. Els presos comuns no hi tenien accés. Els murs que l&rsquo;envoltaven, d&rsquo;un gruix extraordinari, aïllaven qualsevol soroll exterior. El caràcter egipci de la construcció em va ofegar amb la seva melancolia. Però sota els peus creixia una herba tendra i empresonada. Com si fos el cor de les piràmides eternes, on, per algun estrany miracle, entre les esquerdes havien brollat llavors d&rsquo;herba que els ocells hi havien deixat caure.</p>
<p>Estranyament ajupit a la base del mur, amb els genolls encongits i estirat de costat, el cap tocant les pedres fredes, vaig veure en Bartleby, consumit. Però no es movia res. Vaig aturar-me; després m&rsquo;hi vaig acostar; em vaig inclinar i vaig veure que tenia els ulls apagats oberts; altrament semblava profundament adormit. Alguna cosa em va impulsar a tocar-lo. Li vaig agafar la mà i un calfred formigós em va pujar pel braç i baixar per l&rsquo;esquena fins als peus.</p>
<p>La cara rodona de l&rsquo;encarregat del menjar es va acostar a mi. «El dinar està llest. Tampoc menjarà avui? O és que viu sense menjar?»</p>
<p>«Viu sense menjar», vaig dir, i li vaig tancar els ulls.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh! Dorm, oi?»</p>
<p>&lsquo;Amb reis i consellers», vaig murmurar.</p>
<p>No cal continuar més en aquesta història. El lector ja s&rsquo;imaginarà el trist relat de l&rsquo;enterrament del pobre Bartleby. Però abans d&rsquo;acomiadar-me del lector, deixeu-me dir que, si aquesta petita narració l&rsquo;ha interessat prou per despertar-li la curiositat sobre qui era Bartleby i quin tipus de vida va dur abans que el present narrador el conegués, només puc respondre que comparteixo plenament aquesta curiositat, però sóc del tot incapaç de satisfer-la. Tanmateix, aquí amb prou feines sé si hauria de revelar un petit rumor que em va arribar uns mesos després de la mort de l&rsquo;escrivent. Sobre quina base es recolzava, mai no ho vaig poder esbrinar; i per tant, no puc dir ara com de cert és. Però atès que aquest informe vague no ha deixat de tenir un cert interès suggestiu i estrany per a mi, per molt trist que sigui, potser tindrà el mateix efecte en d&rsquo;altres; així que el mencionaré breument. L&rsquo;informe era aquest: que Bartleby havia estat un oficial subaltern a l&rsquo;Oficina de Cartes Mortes a Washington, d&rsquo;on havia estat sobtadament destituït per un canvi d&rsquo;administració. Quan penso en aquest rumor, no puc expressar adequadament les emocions que s&rsquo;apoderen de mi. Cartes mortes! No sona com a homes morts? Imagineu un home que per naturalesa i desgràcia és propens a una desesperança pàl·lida: pot haver-hi cap negoci que sembli més adequat per augmentar-la que el de manejar contínuament aquestes cartes mortes, i classificar-les per a les flames? Perquè cada any en cremen carretades. De vegades, de dins d&rsquo;un paper plegat, l&rsquo;oficial pàl·lid treu un anell: el dit al qual estava destinat, potser, es podreix a la tomba; un bitllet de banc enviat amb la màxima urgència per caritat: aquell a qui hauria alleujat, ja no menja ni passa gana; perdó per als qui van morir desesperats; esperança per als qui van morir sense esperança; bones notícies per als qui van morir ofegats per calamitats sense remei. En missions de vida, aquestes cartes corren cap a la mort.</p>
<p>Ah, Bartleby! Ah, humanitat!</p>
