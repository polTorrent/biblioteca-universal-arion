                <div class="section" id="orig-1" data-parallel="trad-1">
                    <p><em>Edgar Allan Poe</em></p>
                </div>
                

                <div class="section" id="orig-2" data-parallel="trad-2">
                    <p>The chateau into which my valet had ventured to make forcible entrance, rather than permit me, in my desperately wounded condition, to pass a night in the open air, was one of those piles of commingled gloom and grandeur which have so long frowned among the Apennines, not less in fact than in the fancy of Mrs. Radcliffe. To all appearance it had been temporarily and very lately abandoned. We established ourselves in one of the smallest and least sumptuously furnished apartments. It lay in a remote turret of the building. Its decorations were rich, yet tattered and antique. Its walls were hung with tapestry and bedecked with manifold and multiform armorial trophies, together with an unusually great number of very spirited modern paintings in frames of rich golden arabesque. In these paintings, which depended from the walls not only in their main surfaces, but in very many nooks which the bizarre architecture of the chateau rendered necessary—in these paintings my incipient delirium, perhaps, had caused me to take deep interest; so that I bade Pedro to close the heavy shutters of the room—since it was already night—to light the tongues of a tall candelabrum which stood by the head of my bed—and to throw open far and wide the fringed curtains of black velvet which enveloped the bed itself. I wished all this done that I might resign myself, if not to sleep, at least alternately to the contemplation of these pictures, and the perusal of a small volume which had been found upon the pillow, and which purported to criticise and describe them.</p>
<p>Long—long I read—and devoutly, devotedly I gazed. Rapidly and gloriously the hours flew by, and the deep midnight came.</p>
<p>The position of the candelabrum displeased me, and outreaching my hand with difficulty, rather than disturb my slumbering valet, I placed it so as to throw its rays more fully upon the book.</p>
<p>But the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated. The rays of the numerous candles (for there were many) now fell within a niche of the room which had hitherto been thrown into deep shade by one of the bed-posts. I thus saw in vivid light a picture all unnoticed before. It was the portrait of a young girl just ripening into womanhood. I glanced at the painting hurriedly, and then closed my eyes. Why I did this was not at first apparent even to my own perception. But while my lids remained thus shut, I ran over in mind my reason for so shutting them. It was an impulsive movement to gain time for thought—to make sure that my vision had not deceived me—to calm and subdue my fancy for a more sober and more certain gaze. In a very few moments I again looked fixedly at the painting.</p>
<p>That I now saw aright I could not and would not doubt; for the first flashing of the candles upon that canvas had seemed to dissipate the dreamy stupor which was stealing over my senses, and to startle me at once into waking life.</p>
<p>The portrait, I have already said, was that of a young girl. It was a mere head and shoulders, done in what is technically termed a <em>vignette</em> manner; much in the style of the favorite heads of Sully. The arms, the bosom and even the ends of the radiant hair, melted imperceptibly into the vague yet deep shadow which formed the background of the whole. The frame was oval, richly gilded and filigreed in <em>Moresque</em>. As a thing of art nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself. But it could have been neither the execution of the work, nor the immortal beauty of the countenance, which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved me. Least of all, could it have been that my fancy, shaken from its half slumber, had mistaken the head for that of a living person. I saw at once that the peculiarities of the design, of the <em>vignetting</em>, and of the frame, must have instantly dispelled such idea—must have prevented even its momentary entertainment. Thinking earnestly upon these points, I remained, for an hour perhaps, half sitting, half reclining, with my vision riveted upon the portrait. At length, satisfied with the true secret of its effect, I fell back within the bed. I had found the spell of the picture in an absolute <em>life-likeliness</em> of expression, which, at first startling, finally confounded, subdued and appalled me. With deep and reverent awe I replaced the candelabrum in its former position. The cause of my deep agitation being thus shut from view, I sought eagerly the volume which discussed the paintings and their histories. Turning to the number which designated the oval portrait, I there read the vague and quaint words which follow:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee. And evil was the hour when she saw, and loved, and wedded the painter. He, passionate, studious, austere, and having already a bride in his Art; she a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee: all light and smiles, and frolicsome as the young fawn: loving and cherishing all things: hating only the Art which was her rival: dreading only the palette and brushes and other untoward instruments which deprived her of the countenance of her lover. It was thus a terrible thing for this lady to hear the painter speak of his desire to portray even his young bride. But she was humble and obedient, and sat meekly for many weeks in the dark high turret-chamber where the light dripped upon the pale canvas only from overhead. But he, the painter, took glory in his work, which went on from hour to hour, and from day to day. And he was a passionate, and wild, and moody man, who became lost in reveries; so that he <em>would</em> not see that the light which fell so ghastlily in that lone turret withered the health and the spirits of his bride, who pined visibly to all but him. Yet she smiled on and still on, uncomplainingly, because she saw that the painter, (who had high renown,) took a fervid and burning pleasure in his task, and wrought day and night to depict her who so loved him, yet who grew daily more dispirited and weak. And in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of its resemblance in low words, as of a mighty marvel, and a proof not less of the power of the painter than of his deep love for her whom he depicted so surpassingly well. But at length, as the labor drew nearer to its conclusion, there were admitted none into the turret; for the painter had grown wild with the ardor of his work, and turned his eyes from the canvas rarely, even to regard the countenance of his wife. And he <em>would</em> not see that the tints which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from the cheeks of her who sat beside him. And when many weeks had passed, and but little remained to do, save one brush upon the mouth and one tint upon the eye, the spirit of the lady again flickered up as the flame within the socket of the lamp. And then the brush was given, and then the tint was placed; and, for one moment, the painter stood entranced before the work which he had wrought; but in the next, while he yet gazed, he grew tremulous and very pallid, and aghast, and crying with a loud voice, &lsquo;This is indeed <em>Life</em> itself!&rsquo; turned suddenly to regard his beloved:—<em>She was dead!</em>&ldquo;</p>

Les seves parets estaven cobertes de tapissos i ornamentades amb múltiples i multiformes trofeus heràldics, juntament amb un nombre extraordinàriament gran de pintures modernes molt vivaces emmarcades en rics arabescs daurats<sup><a href="#nota-4" class="note-ref" id="ref-4">[4]</a></sup>. En aquestes pintures, que penjaven de les parets no solament en les seves superfícies principals, sinó en molts racons que l&rsquo;arquitectura bizarra del castell feia necessaris —en aquestes pintures el meu deliri incipient, potser, m&rsquo;havia fet prendre un profund interès; de manera que vaig manar a Pedro que tanqués les pesades persianes de la cambra —ja que ja era de nit—, que encengués les llums del canelobre alt que estava a capçalera del meu llit, i que obrís del tot les cortines orlades de vellut negre que embolicaven el llit mateix. Volia tot això perquè pogués abandonar-me, si no al son, almenys alternativament a la contemplació d&rsquo;aquestes pintures i a la lectura d&rsquo;un petit volum que havia estat trobat sobre el coixí, i que pretenia criticar-les i descriure-les.</p>
<p>Llargament—llargament vaig llegir—i devotament, devotament vaig contemplar. Ràpidament i gloriosament volaren les hores, i la mitjanit profunda arribà.</p>
<p>La posició del canelobre em desagradava, i alçant la mà amb dificultat, més aviat que no pas molestar el meu criat adormit, el vaig col·locar de manera que projectés els seus raigs més plenament sobre el llibre.</p>
<p>Però l&rsquo;acció va produir un efecte del tot inesperat. Els raigs dels nombrosos ciris van caure aleshores en una fornícula de la cambra que fins aleshores havia estat sumida en una ombra profunda per un dels pilars del llit. Així vaig veure amb llum viva una pintura del tot inadvertida abans. Era el retrat d&rsquo;una jove que just esdevenia dona. Vaig mirar la pintura precipitadament, i després vaig tancar els ulls. Per què ho feia no era evident al principi ni tan sols a la meva pròpia percepció. Però mentre les meves parpelles romanien així tancades, vaig repassar mentalment la meva raó per tancar-les així. Va ser un moviment impulsiu per guanyar temps per pensar —per assegurar-me que la meva visió no m&rsquo;havia enganyat—, per calmar i sotmetre la meva fantasia per a una mirada més sòbria i més certa. En pocs moments vaig tornar a mirar fixament la pintura.</p>
<p>Que ara veia correctament no ho podia ni <em>no</em> volia dubtar; ja que el primer enlluernament dels ciris sobre aquella tela havia semblat dissipar l&rsquo;estupor somiós que s&rsquo;apoderava dels meus sentits, i despertar-me d&rsquo;una vegada a la vida vigilant.</p>
<p>El retrat, ja ho he dit, era el d&rsquo;una jove. Era només cap i espatlles, fet en el que es denomina tècnicament manera de <em>vinyeta</em><sup><a href="#nota-5" class="note-ref" id="ref-5">[5]</a></sup>; molt a l&rsquo;estil dels caps favorits de Sully<sup><a href="#nota-6" class="note-ref" id="ref-6">[6]</a></sup>. Els braços, el pit i fins i tot les puntes dels cabells radiants es fonien imperceptiblement en l&rsquo;ombra vaga, però profunda que formava el fons del conjunt. El marc era oval, riquament daurat i amb filigranes <em>moresques</em>. Com a cosa d&rsquo;art res no podia ser més admirable que la pintura mateixa. Però no podia haver estat ni l&rsquo;execució de l&rsquo;obra, ni la bellesa immortal del rostre, el que m&rsquo;havia mogut tan sobtadament i tan vehementment. Menys encara podia haver estat que la meva fantasia, treta del seu mig son, hagués confós el cap amb el d&rsquo;una persona viva. Vaig veure immediatament que les peculiaritats del disseny, de la <em>vinyeta</em>, i del marc, havien d&rsquo;haver dissipat instantàniament tal idea —havien d&rsquo;haver impedit fins i tot la seva consideració momentània. Pensant seriosament en aquests punts, vaig romandre, durant una hora potser, mig assegut, mig recolzat, amb la vista clavada al retrat. Finalment, satisfet amb el veritable secret del seu efecte, em vaig deixar caure dins del llit. Havia trobat l&rsquo;encant de la pintura en una absoluta <em>semblança vital</em><sup><a href="#nota-7" class="note-ref" id="ref-7">[7]</a></sup> d&rsquo;expressió, que, primer sorprenent, finalment em confongué, em sotmeté i em va horroritzar. Amb profunda i reverencial veneració vaig tornar a col·locar el canelobre en la seva posició anterior. La causa de la meva profunda agitació quedà així tancada de la vista. Vaig buscar amb ànsia el volum que discutia les pintures i les seves històries. Girant fins al número que designava el retrat oval, hi vaig llegir les paraules vagues i curioses que segueixen:</p>
<p>«Era una donzella de la més rara bellesa, i no més encantadora que plena d&rsquo;alegria. I dolenta fou l&rsquo;hora quan va veure, i va estimar, i es va casar amb el pintor. Ell, apassionat, estudiós, auster, ja tenia una núvia en el seu Art; ella una donzella de la més rara bellesa, i no més encantadora que plena d&rsquo;alegria: tota llum i somriures, i juganera com el cérvol jove: estimant i preant totes les coses: odiant només l&rsquo;Art que era el seu rival: tement només la paleta i els pinzells i altres instruments adversos que la privaven del rostre del seu estimat. Així va ser cosa terrible per a aquesta dama sentir el pintor parlar del seu desig de retratar fins i tot la seva jove núvia. Però ella era humil i obedient, i va seure mansament durant moltes setmanes a la cambra fosca i alta de la torreta on la llum goterava sobre la tela pàl·lida només des de dalt. Però ell, el pintor, es gloriava en la seva obra, que avançava d&rsquo;hora en hora, i de dia en dia. I era un home apassionat, i salvatge, i capritxós, que es perdia en ensomnis; de manera que <em>no</em> volia veure que la llum que queia tan espectralment en aquella torreta solitària consumia la salut i els esperits de la seva núvia, que visiblement es consumia per a tots excepte per a ell. Però ella somrigué i seguí somrient, sense queixar-se, perquè veia que el pintor (que tenia gran renòm) prenia un plaer fervid i ardent en la seva tasca, i treballava dia i nit per representar-la a ella que tant l&rsquo;estimava, però que es tornava cada dia més desanimada i feble. De fet, alguns que contemplaren el retrat parlaren de la seva semblança en veu baixa, com d&rsquo;una meravella poderosa, i una prova no menor del poder del pintor que del seu profund amor per aquella que representava tan extraordinàriament bé. Però finalment, quan el treball s&rsquo;apropà a la seva conclusió, no fou admès ningú a la torreta; perquè el pintor s&rsquo;havia tornat boig amb l&rsquo;ardor de la seva obra, i rarament apartava els ulls de la tela, fins i tot per mirar el rostre de la seva esposa. I <em>no</em> volia veure que els tints que estenia sobre la tela eren trets de les galtes d&rsquo;aquella que seia al seu costat. I quan moltes setmanes haguessin passat, i poc quedava per fer, llevat d&rsquo;una pinzellada a la boca i un tint a l&rsquo;ull, l&rsquo;esperit de la dama es va revifar altra vegada com la flama dins del mig del llum<sup><a href="#nota-8" class="note-ref" id="ref-8">[8]</a></sup>. I aleshores la pinzellada fou donada, i aleshores el tint fou posat; i, per un moment, el pintor es va quedar en èxtasi davant de l&rsquo;obra que havia fet; però en el següent, mentre encara mirava, es va tornar tremolós i molt pàl·lid, i espaordit, i cridant amb veu alta: —¡Això és, de fet, la <em>Vida</em> mateixa! —es va girar sobtadament per mirar la seva estimada: Estava morta!»</p>
