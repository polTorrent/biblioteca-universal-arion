                <div class="section" id="orig-1" data-parallel="trad-1">

                </div>
                

                <div class="section" id="orig-2" data-parallel="trad-2">
                    <p>THE chateau into which my valet had ventured to make forcible entrance, rather than permit me, in my desperately wounded condition, to pass a night in the open air, was one of those piles of commingled gloom and grandeur which have so long frowned among the Appennines, not less in fact than in the fancy of Mrs. Radcliffe. To all appearance it had been temporarily and very lately abandoned. We established ourselves in one of the smallest and least sumptuously furnished apartments. It lay in a remote turret of the building. Its decorations were rich, yet tattered and antique. Its walls were hung with tapestry and bedecked with manifold and multiform armorial trophies, together with an unusually great number of very spirited modern paintings in frames of rich golden arabesque. In these paintings, which depended from the walls not only in their main surfaces, but in very many nooks which the bizarre architecture of the chateau rendered necessary &ndash; in these paintings my incipient delirium, perhaps, had caused me to take deep interest; so that I bade Pedro to close the heavy shutters of the room &ndash; since it was already night &ndash; to light the tongues of a tall candelabrum which stood by the head of my bed &ndash; and to throw open far and wide the fringed curtains of black velvet which enveloped the bed itself. I wished all this done that I might resign myself, if not to sleep, at least alternately to the contemplation of these pictures, and the perusal of a small volume which had been found upon the pillow, and which purported to criticise and describe them.</p>
<p>Long &ndash; long I read &ndash; and devoutly, devotedly I gazed. Rapidly and gloriously the hours flew by and the deep midnight came. The position of the candelabrum displeased me, and outreaching my hand with difficulty, rather than disturb my slumbering valet, I placed it so as to throw its rays more fully upon the book.</p>
<p>But the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated. The rays of the numerous candles (for there were many) now fell within a niche of the room which had hitherto been thrown into deep shade by one of the bed-posts. I thus saw in vivid light a picture all unnoticed before. It was the portrait of a young girl just ripening into womanhood. I glanced at the painting hurriedly, and then closed my eyes. Why I did this was not at first apparent even to my own perception. But while my lids remained thus shut, I ran over in my mind my reason for so shutting them. It was an impulsive movement to gain time for thought &ndash; to make sure that my vision had not deceived me &ndash; to calm and subdue my fancy for a more sober and more certain gaze. In a very few moments I again looked fixedly at the painting.</p>
<p>That I now saw aright I could not and would not doubt; for the first flashing of the candles upon that canvas had seemed to dissipate the dreamy stupor which was stealing over my senses, and to startle me at once into waking life.</p>
<p>The portrait, I have already said, was that of a young girl. It was a mere head and shoulders, done in what is technically termed a vignette manner; much in the style of the favorite heads of Sully. The arms, the bosom, and even the ends of the radiant hair melted imperceptibly into the vague yet deep shadow which formed the back-ground of the whole. The frame was oval, richly gilded and filigreed in Moresque. As a thing of art nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself. But it could have been neither the execution of the work, nor the immortal beauty of the countenance, which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved me. Least of all, could it have been that my fancy, shaken from its half slumber, had mistaken the head for that of a living person. I saw at once that the peculiarities of the design, of the vignetting, and of the frame, must have instantly dispelled such idea &ndash; must have prevented even its momentary entertainment. Thinking earnestly upon these points, I remained, for an hour perhaps, half sitting, half reclining, with my vision riveted upon the portrait. At length, satisfied with the true secret of its effect, I fell back within the bed. I had found the spell of the picture in an absolute life-likeliness of expression, which, at first startling, finally confounded, subdued, and appalled me. With deep and reverent awe I replaced the candelabrum in its former position. The cause of my deep agitation being thus shut from view, I sought eagerly the volume which discussed the paintings and their histories. Turning to the number which designated the oval portrait, I there read the vague and quaint words which follow:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee. And evil was the hour when she saw, and loved, and wedded the painter. He, passionate, studious, austere, and having already a bride in his Art; she a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee; all light and smiles, and frolicsome as the young fawn; loving and cherishing all things; hating only the Art which was her rival; dreading only the pallet and brushes and other untoward instruments which deprived her of the countenance of her lover. It was thus a terrible thing for this lady to hear the painter speak of his desire to pourtray even his young bride. But she was humble and obedient, and sat meekly for many weeks in the dark, high turret-chamber where the light dripped upon the pale canvas only from overhead. But he, the painter, took glory in his work, which went on from hour to hour, and from day to day. And he was a passionate, and wild, and moody man, who became lost in reveries; so that he would not see that the light which fell so ghastly in that lone turret withered the health and the spirits of his bride, who pined visibly to all but him. Yet she smiled on and still on, uncomplainingly, because she saw that the painter (who had high renown) took a fervid and burning pleasure in his task, and wrought day and night to depict her who so loved him, yet who grew daily more dispirited and weak. And in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of its resemblance in low words, as of a mighty marvel, and a proof not less of the power of the painter than of his deep love for her whom he depicted so surpassingly well. But at length, as the labor drew nearer to its conclusion, there were admitted none into the turret; for the painter had grown wild with the ardor of his work, and turned his eyes from canvas merely, even to regard the countenance of his wife. And he would not see that the tints which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from the cheeks of her who sate beside him. And when many weeks bad passed, and but little remained to do, save one brush upon the mouth and one tint upon the eye, the spirit of the lady again flickered up as the flame within the socket of the lamp. And then the brush was given, and then the tint was placed; and, for one moment, the painter stood entranced before the work which he had wrought; but in the next, while he yet gazed, he grew tremulous and very pallid, and aghast, and crying with a loud voice, &lsquo;This is indeed Life itself!&rsquo; turned suddenly to regard his beloved: &ndash; She was dead!&rdquo;</p>

Per tot el que es veia, havia estat abandonat recentment i de manera temporal. Ens instal·làrem en una de les cambres més petites i menys luxosament moblades. Es trobava en una torre apartada de l&rsquo;edifici. Les decoracions eren riques però esquinçades i antigues. Les parets lluïen tapissos i una gran quantitat de trofeus heràldics<sup><a href="#nota-3" class="note-ref" id="ref-3">[3]</a></sup> de tota mena, juntament amb un nombre inusualment gran de pintures modernes molt expressives emmarcades en ric arabesc daurat. Aquestes pintures penjaven no només de les parets principals, sinó també dels molts racons que l&rsquo;arquitectura capritxosa del castell feia necessaris —i en aquestes pintures el meu deliri incipient, potser, m&rsquo;havia fet interessar-me profundament. Per això vaig demanar a Pedro que tanqués les pesades persianes de la cambra —ja que era de nit—, que encengués les llengües d&rsquo;un alt canelobre que hi havia al capçal del meu llit, i que obrís de bat a bat les cortines frangetjades de vellut negre que embolcallaven el llit mateix. Volia que tot això es fes per poder abandonar-me, si no al son, almenys alternativament a la contemplació d&rsquo;aquestes pintures i a la lectura d&rsquo;un petit volum que s&rsquo;havia trobat damunt el coixí i que pretenia descriure-les i comentar-les.</p>
<p>Llargament —molt llargament— vaig llegir, i devotament, ferventment, vaig contemplar. Les hores volaren ràpides i glorioses, i arribà la mitjanit profunda. La posició del canelobre em desplaïa, i estenent la mà amb dificultat, per no molestar el meu criat adormit, el vaig col·locar de manera que els seus raigs il·luminessin més plenament el llibre.</p>
<p>Però l&rsquo;acció produí un efecte del tot inesperat. Els raigs de les nombroses espelmes (car n&rsquo;hi havia moltes) caigueren ara dins un nínxol de la cambra que fins aleshores havia romàs en ombra profunda, ocult per una de les columnes del llit. Així vaig veure en llum vívida un quadre fins llavors inadvertit. Era el retrat d&rsquo;una noia que tot just descloia cap a la dona. Vaig mirar la pintura de pressa, i després vaig tancar els ulls. Per què ho vaig fer no em fou evident al principi ni tan sols a mi mateix. Però mentre les meves parpelles romanien closes, vaig repassar mentalment la raó d&rsquo;haver-les tancat. Fou un moviment impulsiu per guanyar temps per pensar —per assegurar-me que la meva visió no m&rsquo;havia enganyat—, per calmar i dominar la meva imaginació per a una contemplació més serena i més certa. Al cap d&rsquo;uns instants vaig tornar a mirar fixament la pintura.</p>
<p>Que ara veia correctament no podia ni volia dubtar-ho; perquè el primer resplandor de les espelmes sobre aquella tela havia semblat dissipar l&rsquo;estupor somort que s&rsquo;apoderava dels meus sentits i despertar-me de cop a la vigília.</p>
<p>El retrat, ja ho he dit, era el d&rsquo;una noia. Era només el cap i les espatlles, fet en el que tècnicament s&rsquo;anomena manera de vinyeta<sup><a href="#nota-4" class="note-ref" id="ref-4">[4]</a></sup>; molt a l&rsquo;estil dels caps preferits de Sully<sup><a href="#nota-5" class="note-ref" id="ref-5">[5]</a></sup>. Els braços, el pit, i fins i tot les puntes dels cabells radiants es fonien imperceptiblement en l&rsquo;ombra vaga però profunda que formava el fons del conjunt. El marc era oval, ricament daurat i filigranat a la morisca<sup><a href="#nota-6" class="note-ref" id="ref-6">[6]</a></sup>. Com a objecte d&rsquo;art res no podia ser més admirable que la pintura mateixa. Però no podia haver estat ni l&rsquo;execució de l&rsquo;obra, ni la bellesa immortal del rostre, el que m&rsquo;havia commogut tan sobtadament i amb tanta vehemència. Menys encara podia ser que la meva fantasia, despertada del seu mig son, hagués confós el cap amb el d&rsquo;una persona viva. Vaig veure immediatament que les peculiaritats del disseny, de la vinyeta i del marc haurien dissipat a l&rsquo;instant tal idea —haurien impedit fins i tot que es considerés ni per un instant. Pensant seriosament en aquests punts, vaig romandre, potser una hora, mig assegut, mig reclinat, amb la visió clavada en el retrat. Finalment, satisfet del veritable secret del seu efecte, em vaig deixar caure dins el llit. Havia trobat l&rsquo;encanteri del quadre en una absoluta semblança a la vida en l&rsquo;expressió, que, primer sorprenent, finalment em va confondre, sotmetre i espantar. Amb un temor profund i reverencial vaig tornar el canelobre a la seva posició anterior. La causa de la meva agitació profunda, així amagada de la vista, vaig cercar àvidament el volum que parlava de les pintures i les seves històries. Girant al número que designava el retrat oval, hi vaig llegir les paraules vagues i estranyes que segueixen:</p>
<p>«Era una donzella de bellesa raríssima, i no menys alegre que encisadora. I maleïda fou l&rsquo;hora en què ella veié, estimà i es casà amb el pintor. Ell, apassionat, estudiós, auster, i ja amb una esposa en el seu Art; ella, una donzella de bellesa raríssima, i no menys alegre que encisadora; tota llum i somriures, i enjogassada com el jove cérvol; estimant i acariciant totes les coses; odiant només l&rsquo;Art que era la seva rival; tement només la paleta i els pinzells i els altres instruments malaurats que la privaven del rostre del seu estimat. Fou doncs cosa terrible per aquesta dama sentir el pintor parlar del seu desig de retratar fins i tot la seva jove esposa. Però ella era humil i obedient, i va seure mansament durant moltes setmanes a la cambra fosca de la torre alta on la llum regalimava sobre la tela pàl·lida només des de dalt. Però ell, el pintor, s&rsquo;enorgullia de la seva obra, que avançava d&rsquo;hora en hora, i de dia en dia. I era un home apassionat, i salvatge, i malenconiós, que es perdia en somieigs; de manera que no volia veure que la llum que queia tan lúgubrament en aquella torre solitària marcia la salut i els ànims de la seva esposa, que es consumia visiblement per a tothom excepte per a ell. Però ella seguia somrient, i encara somrient, sense queixar-se, perquè veia que el pintor (que tenia gran renom) sentia un plaer fèrvid i ardent en la seva tasca, i treballava dia i nit per representar aquella qui tant l&rsquo;estimava, però que cada dia es tornava més desanimada i feble. I en veritat alguns que veien el retrat parlaven de la seva semblança en veu baixa, com d&rsquo;una meravella poderosa, i una prova no menys del poder del pintor que del seu amor profund per aquella a qui representava tan insuperablement bé. Però finalment, quan la tasca s&rsquo;acostava a la seva conclusió, ningú no fou admès a la torre; perquè el pintor s&rsquo;havia tornat boig amb l&rsquo;ardor de la seva obra, i apartava els ulls de la tela fins i tot per mirar el rostre de la seva esposa. I no volia veure que les tintes que escampava sobre la tela eren extretes de les galtes d&rsquo;aquella que seia al seu costat. I quan moltes setmanes hagueren passat, i poc restava per fer, només un toc de pinzell sobre la boca i una ombra a l&rsquo;ull, l&rsquo;esperit de la dama vacil·là de nou com la flama dins la cassoleta del llum. I aleshores el pinzell fou donat, i aleshores l&rsquo;ombra fou posada; i, per un moment, el pintor romangué extasiat davant l&rsquo;obra que havia creat; però a l&rsquo;instant següent, mentre encara contemplava, es tornà tremolós i molt pàl·lid, i espantat, i cridant amb veu forta: &ldquo;Això és certament la Vida mateixa!&rdquo;, es girà sobtadament per mirar la seva estimada: —Ella era morta!»</p>

En la literatura gòtica del segle XVIII i XIX, els Apenins i els Alps es convertiren en escenaris predilectes per ambientar històries de terror i misteri, amb els seus castells abandonats i paisatges salvatges. Poe, com a mestre del gòtic americà, adopta conscientment aquesta convenció europea.</p>

Les seves obres, especialment <em>Els misteris d&rsquo;Udolfo</em> (1794) i <em>L&rsquo;italià</em> (1797), establiren els convencionalismes del gènere: castells italians misteriosos, donzelles en perill, atmosferes opressives. La referència explícita de Poe és un homenatge i una declaració d&rsquo;intencions: el lector sap que entra en territori gòtic.</p>

Aquesta tècnica crea un efecte eteri i misteriós, particularment adequat per a retrats que volen capturar quelcom més que la mera aparença física.</p>
