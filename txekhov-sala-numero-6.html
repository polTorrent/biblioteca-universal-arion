                    <h2>I</h2>
<p>In the hospital yard there stands a small lodge surrounded by a
perfect forest of burdocks, nettles, and wild hemp. Its roof is
rusty, the chimney is tumbling down, the steps at the front-door
are rotting away and overgrown with grass, and there are only traces
left of the stucco. The front of the lodge faces the hospital; at
the back it looks out into the open country, from which it is
separated by the grey hospital fence with nails on it. These nails,
with their points upwards, and the fence, and the lodge itself,
have that peculiar, desolate, God-forsaken look which is only found
in our hospital and prison buildings.</p>
<p>If you are not afraid of being stung by the nettles, come by the
narrow footpath that leads to the lodge, and let us see what is
going on inside. Opening the first door, we walk into the entry.
Here along the walls and by the stove every sort of hospital rubbish
lies littered about. Mattresses, old tattered dressing-gowns,
trousers, blue striped shirts, boots and shoes no good for
anything&ndash;all these remnants are piled up in heaps, mixed up and crumpled,
mouldering and giving out a sickly smell.</p>
<p>The porter, Nikita, an old soldier wearing rusty good-conduct
stripes, is always lying on the litter with a pipe between his
teeth. He has a grim, surly, battered-looking face, overhanging
eyebrows which give him the expression of a sheep-dog of the steppes,
and a red nose; he is short and looks thin and scraggy, but he is
of imposing deportment and his fists are vigorous. He belongs to
the class of simple-hearted, practical, and dull-witted people,
prompt in carrying out orders, who like discipline better than
anything in the world, and so are convinced that it is their duty
to beat people. He showers blows on the face, on the chest, on the
back, on whatever comes first, and is convinced that there would
be no order in the place if he did not.</p>
<p>Next you come into a big, spacious room which fills up the whole
lodge except for the entry. Here the walls are painted a dirty blue,
the ceiling is as sooty as in a hut without a chimney&ndash;it is
evident that in the winter the stove smokes and the room is full
of fumes. The windows are disfigured by iron gratings on the inside.
The wooden floor is grey and full of splinters. There is a stench
of sour cabbage, of smouldering wicks, of bugs, and of ammonia, and
for the first minute this stench gives you the impression of having
walked into a menagerie.</p>
<p>There are bedsteads screwed to the floor. Men in blue hospital
dressing-gowns, and wearing nightcaps in the old style, are sitting
and lying on them. These are the lunatics.</p>
<p>There are five of them in all here. Only one is of the upper class,
the rest are all artisans. The one nearest the door&ndash;a tall, lean
workman with shining red whiskers and tear-stained eyes&ndash;sits
with his head propped on his hand, staring at the same point. Day
and night he grieves, shaking his head, sighing and smiling bitterly.
He takes a part in conversation and usually makes no answer to
questions; he eats and drinks mechanically when food is offered
him. From his agonizing, throbbing cough, his thinness, and the
flush on his cheeks, one may judge that he is in the first stage
of consumption. Next to him is a little, alert, very lively old
man, with a pointed beard and curly black hair like a negro&rsquo;s. By
day he walks up and down the ward from window to window, or sits
on his bed, cross-legged like a Turk, and, ceaselessly as a bullfinch
whistles, softly sings and titters. He shows his childish gaiety
and lively character at night also when he gets up to say his
prayers&ndash;that is, to beat himself on the chest with his fists, and to
scratch with his fingers at the door. This is the Jew Moiseika, an
imbecile, who went crazy twenty years ago when his hat factory was
burnt down.</p>
<p>And of all the inhabitants of Ward No. 6, he is the only one who
is allowed to go out of the lodge, and even out of the yard into
the street. He has enjoyed this privilege for years, probably because
he is an old inhabitant of the hospital&ndash;a quiet, harmless imbecile,
the buffoon of the town, where people are used to seeing him
surrounded by boys and dogs. In his wretched gown, in his absurd
night-cap, and in slippers, sometimes with bare legs and even without
trousers, he walks about the streets, stopping at the gates and
little shops, and begging for a copper. In one place they will give
him some kvass, in another some bread, in another a copper, so that
he generally goes back to the ward feeling rich and well fed.
Everything that he brings back Nikita takes from him for his own
benefit. The soldier does this roughly, angrily turning the Jew&rsquo;s
pockets inside out, and calling God to witness that he will not let
him go into the street again, and that breach of the regulations
is worse to him than anything in the world.</p>
<p>Moiseika likes to make himself useful. He gives his companions
water, and covers them up when they are asleep; he promises each
of them to bring him back a kopeck, and to make him a new cap; he
feeds with a spoon his neighbour on the left, who is paralyzed. He
acts in this way, not from compassion nor from any considerations
of a humane kind, but through imitation, unconsciously dominated
by Gromov, his neighbour on the right hand.</p>
<p>Ivan Dmitritch Gromov, a man of thirty-three, who is a gentleman
by birth, and has been a court usher and provincial secretary,
suffers from the mania of persecution. He either lies curled up in
bed, or walks from corner to corner as though for exercise; he very
rarely sits down. He is always excited, agitated, and overwrought
by a sort of vague, undefined expectation. The faintest rustle in
the entry or shout in the yard is enough to make him raise his head
and begin listening: whether they are coming for him, whether they
are looking for him. And at such times his face expresses the utmost
uneasiness and repulsion.</p>
<p>I like his broad face with its high cheek-bones, always pale and
unhappy, and reflecting, as though in a mirror, a soul tormented
by conflict and long-continued terror. His grimaces are strange and
abnormal, but the delicate lines traced on his face by profound,
genuine suffering show intelligence and sense, and there is a warm
and healthy light in his eyes. I like the man himself, courteous,
anxious to be of use, and extraordinarily gentle to everyone except
Nikita. When anyone drops a button or a spoon, he jumps up from his
bed quickly and picks it up; every day he says good-morning to his
companions, and when he goes to bed he wishes them good-night.</p>
<p>Besides his continually overwrought condition and his grimaces, his
madness shows itself in the following way also. Sometimes in the
evenings he wraps himself in his dressing-gown, and, trembling all
over, with his teeth chattering, begins walking rapidly from corner
to corner and between the bedsteads. It seems as though he is in a
violent fever. From the way he suddenly stops and glances at his
companions, it can be seen that he is longing to say something very
important, but, apparently reflecting that they would not listen,
or would not understand him, he shakes his head impatiently and
goes on pacing up and down. But soon the desire to speak gets the
upper hand of every consideration, and he will let himself go and
speak fervently and passionately. His talk is disordered and feverish
like delirium, disconnected, and not always intelligible, but, on
the other hand, something extremely fine may be felt in it, both
in the words and the voice. When he talks you recognize in him the
lunatic and the man. It is difficult to reproduce on paper his
insane talk. He speaks of the baseness of mankind, of violence
trampling on justice, of the glorious life which will one day be
upon earth, of the window-gratings, which remind him every minute
of the stupidity and cruelty of oppressors. It makes a disorderly,
incoherent potpourri of themes old but not yet out of date.</p>
<h2>II</h2>
<p>Some twelve or fifteen years ago an official called Gromov, a highly
respectable and prosperous person, was living in his own house in
the principal street of the town. He had two sons, Sergey and Ivan.
When Sergey was a student in his fourth year he was taken ill with
galloping consumption and died, and his death was, as it were, the
first of a whole series of calamities which suddenly showered on
the Gromov family. Within a week of Sergey&rsquo;s funeral the old father
was put on trial for fraud and misappropriation, and he died of
typhoid in the prison hospital soon afterwards. The house, with all
their belongings, was sold by auction, and Ivan Dmitritch and his
mother were left entirely without means.</p>
<p>Hitherto in his father&rsquo;s lifetime, Ivan Dmitritch, who was studying
in the University of Petersburg, had received an allowance of sixty
or seventy roubles a month, and had had no conception of poverty;
now he had to make an abrupt change in his life. He had to spend
his time from morning to night giving lessons for next to nothing,
to work at copying, and with all that to go hungry, as all his
earnings were sent to keep his mother. Ivan Dmitritch could not
stand such a life; he lost heart and strength, and, giving up the
university, went home.</p>
<p>Here, through interest, he obtained the post of teacher in the
district school, but could not get on with his colleagues, was not
liked by the boys, and soon gave up the post. His mother died. He
was for six months without work, living on nothing but bread and
water; then he became a court usher. He kept this post until he was
dismissed owing to his illness.</p>
<p>He had never even in his young student days given the impression
of being perfectly healthy. He had always been pale, thin, and given
to catching cold; he ate little and slept badly. A single glass of
wine went to his head and made him hysterical. He always had a
craving for society, but, owing to his irritable temperament and
suspiciousness, he never became very intimate with anyone, and had
no friends. He always spoke with contempt of his fellow-townsmen,
saying that their coarse ignorance and sleepy animal existence
seemed to him loathsome and horrible. He spoke in a loud tenor,
with heat, and invariably either with scorn and indignation, or
with wonder and enthusiasm, and always with perfect sincerity.
Whatever one talked to him about he always brought it round to the
same subject: that life was dull and stifling in the town; that the
townspeople had no lofty interests, but lived a dingy, meaningless
life, diversified by violence, coarse profligacy, and hypocrisy;
that scoundrels were well fed and clothed, while honest men lived
from hand to mouth; that they needed schools, a progressive local
paper, a theatre, public lectures, the co-ordination of the
intellectual elements; that society must see its failings and be
horrified. In his criticisms of people he laid on the colours thick,
using only black and white, and no fine shades; mankind was divided
for him into honest men and scoundrels: there was nothing in between.
He always spoke with passion and enthusiasm of women and of love,
but he had never been in love.</p>
<p>In spite of the severity of his judgments and his nervousness, he
was liked, and behind his back was spoken of affectionately as
Vanya. His innate refinement and readiness to be of service, his
good breeding, his moral purity, and his shabby coat, his frail
appearance and family misfortunes, aroused a kind, warm, sorrowful
feeling. Moreover, he was well educated and well read; according
to the townspeople&rsquo;s notions, he knew everything, and was in their
eyes something like a walking encyclopedia.</p>
<p>He had read a great deal. He would sit at the club, nervously pulling
at his beard and looking through the magazines and books; and from
his face one could see that he was not reading, but devouring the
pages without giving himself time to digest what he read. It must
be supposed that reading was one of his morbid habits, as he fell
upon anything that came into his hands with equal avidity, even
last year&rsquo;s newspapers and calendars. At home he always read lying
down.</p>
<h2>III</h2>
<p>One autumn morning Ivan Dmitritch, turning up the collar of his
greatcoat and splashing through the mud, made his way by side-streets
and back lanes to see some artisan, and to collect some payment
that was owing. He was in a gloomy mood, as he always was in the
morning. In one of the side-streets he was met by two convicts in
fetters and four soldiers with rifles in charge of them. Ivan
Dmitritch had very often met convicts before, and they had always
excited feelings of compassion and discomfort in him; but now this
meeting made a peculiar, strange impression on him. It suddenly
seemed to him for some reason that he, too, might be put into fetters
and led through the mud to prison like that. After visiting the
artisan, on the way home he met near the post office a police
superintendent of his acquaintance, who greeted him and walked a
few paces along the street with him, and for some reason this seemed
to him suspicious. At home he could not get the convicts or the
soldiers with their rifles out of his head all day, and an unaccountable
inward agitation prevented him from reading or concentrating his
mind. In the evening he did not light his lamp, and at night he
could not sleep, but kept thinking that he might be arrested, put
into fetters, and thrown into prison. He did not know of any harm
he had done, and could be certain that he would never be guilty of
murder, arson, or theft in the future either; but was it not easy
to commit a crime by accident, unconsciously, and was not false
witness always possible, and, indeed, miscarriage of justice? It
was not without good reason that the agelong experience of the
simple people teaches that beggary and prison are ills none can be
safe from. A judicial mistake is very possible as legal proceedings
are conducted nowadays, and there is nothing to be wondered at in
it. People who have an official, professional relation to other
men&rsquo;s sufferings&ndash;for instance, judges, police officers,
doctors&ndash;in course of time, through habit, grow so callous that they
cannot, even if they wish it, take any but a formal attitude to
their clients; in this respect they are not different from the
peasant who slaughters sheep and calves in the back-yard, and does
not notice the blood. With this formal, soulless attitude to human
personality the judge needs but one thing&ndash;time&ndash;in order to
deprive an innocent man of all rights of property, and to condemn
him to penal servitude. Only the time spent on performing certain
formalities for which the judge is paid his salary, and then&ndash;it
is all over. Then you may look in vain for justice and protection
in this dirty, wretched little town a hundred and fifty miles from
a railway station! And, indeed, is it not absurd even to think of
justice when every kind of violence is accepted by society as a
rational and consistent necessity, and every act of mercy&ndash;for
instance, a verdict of acquittal&ndash;calls forth a perfect outburst
of dissatisfied and revengeful feeling?</p>
<p>In the morning Ivan Dmitritch got up from his bed in a state of
horror, with cold perspiration on his forehead, completely convinced
that he might be arrested any minute. Since his gloomy thoughts of
yesterday had haunted him so long, he thought, it must be that there
was some truth in them. They could not, indeed, have come into his
mind without any grounds whatever.</p>
<p>A policeman walking slowly passed by the windows: that was not for
nothing. Here were two men standing still and silent near the house.
Why were they silent? And agonizing days and nights followed for
Ivan Dmitritch. Everyone who passed by the windows or came into the
yard seemed to him a spy or a detective. At midday the chief of the
police usually drove down the street with a pair of horses; he was
going from his estate near the town to the police department; but
Ivan Dmitritch fancied every time that he was driving especially
quickly, and that he had a peculiar expression: it was evident that
he was in haste to announce that there was a very important criminal
in the town. Ivan Dmitritch started at every ring at the bell and
knock at the gate, and was agitated whenever he came upon anyone
new at his landlady&rsquo;s; when he met police officers and gendarmes
he smiled and began whistling so as to seem unconcerned. He could
not sleep for whole nights in succession expecting to be arrested,
but he snored loudly and sighed as though in deep sleep, that his
landlady might think he was asleep; for if he could not sleep it
meant that he was tormented by the stings of conscience&ndash;what a
piece of evidence! Facts and common sense persuaded him that all
these terrors were nonsense and morbidity, that if one looked at
the matter more broadly there was nothing really terrible in arrest
and imprisonment&ndash;so long as the conscience is at ease; but the
more sensibly and logically he reasoned, the more acute and agonizing
his mental distress became. It might be compared with the story of
a hermit who tried to cut a dwelling-place for himself in a virgin
forest; the more zealously he worked with his axe, the thicker the
forest grew. In the end Ivan Dmitritch, seeing it was useless, gave
up reasoning altogether, and abandoned himself entirely to despair
and terror.</p>
<p>He began to avoid people and to seek solitude. His official work
had been distasteful to him before: now it became unbearable to
him. He was afraid they would somehow get him into trouble, would
put a bribe in his pocket unnoticed and then denounce him, or that
he would accidentally make a mistake in official papers that would
appear to be fraudulent, or would lose other people&rsquo;s money. It is
strange that his imagination had never at other times been so agile
and inventive as now, when every day he thought of thousands of
different reasons for being seriously anxious over his freedom and
honour; but, on the other hand, his interest in the outer world,
in books in particular, grew sensibly fainter, and his memory began
to fail him.</p>
<p>In the spring when the snow melted there were found in the ravine
near the cemetery two half-decomposed corpses&ndash;the bodies of an
old woman and a boy bearing the traces of death by violence. Nothing
was talked of but these bodies and their unknown murderers. That
people might not think he had been guilty of the crime, Ivan Dmitritch
walked about the streets, smiling, and when he met acquaintances
he turned pale, flushed, and began declaring that there was no
greater crime than the murder of the weak and defenceless. But this
duplicity soon exhausted him, and after some reflection he decided
that in his position the best thing to do was to hide in his
landlady&rsquo;s cellar. He sat in the cellar all day and then all night,
then another day, was fearfully cold, and waiting till dusk, stole
secretly like a thief back to his room. He stood in the middle of
the room till daybreak, listening without stirring. Very early in
the morning, before sunrise, some workmen came into the house. Ivan
Dmitritch knew perfectly well that they had come to mend the stove
in the kitchen, but terror told him that they were police officers
disguised as workmen. He slipped stealthily out of the flat, and,
overcome by terror, ran along the street without his cap and coat.
Dogs raced after him barking, a peasant shouted somewhere behind
him, the wind whistled in his ears, and it seemed to Ivan Dmitritch
that the force and violence of the whole world was massed together
behind his back and was chasing after him.</p>
<p>He was stopped and brought home, and his landlady sent for a doctor.
Doctor Andrey Yefimitch, of whom we shall have more to say hereafter,
prescribed cold compresses on his head and laurel drops, shook his
head, and went away, telling the landlady he should not come again,
as one should not interfere with people who are going out of their
minds. As he had not the means to live at home and be nursed, Ivan
Dmitritch was soon sent to the hospital, and was there put into the
ward for venereal patients. He could not sleep at night, was full
of whims and fancies, and disturbed the patients, and was soon
afterwards, by Andrey Yefimitch&rsquo;s orders, transferred to Ward No.
6.</p>
<p>Within a year Ivan Dmitritch was completely forgotten in the town,
and his books, heaped up by his landlady in a sledge in the shed,
were pulled to pieces by boys.</p>
<h2>IV</h2>
<p>Ivan Dmitritch&rsquo;s neighbour on the left hand is, as I have said
already, the Jew Moiseika; his neighbour on the right hand is a
peasant so rolling in fat that he is almost spherical, with a blankly
stupid face, utterly devoid of thought. This is a motionless,
gluttonous, unclean animal who has long ago lost all powers of
thought or feeling. An acrid, stifling stench always comes from
him.</p>
<p>Nikita, who has to clean up after him, beats him terribly with all
his might, not sparing his fists; and what is dreadful is not his
being beaten&ndash;that one can get used to&ndash;but the fact that this
stupefied creature does not respond to the blows with a sound or a
movement, nor by a look in the eyes, but only sways a little like
a heavy barrel.</p>
<p>The fifth and last inhabitant of Ward No. 6 is a man of the artisan
class who had once been a sorter in the post office, a thinnish,
fair little man with a good-natured but rather sly face. To judge
from the clear, cheerful look in his calm and intelligent eyes, he
has some pleasant idea in his mind, and has some very important and
agreeable secret. He has under his pillow and under his mattress
something that he never shows anyone, not from fear of its being
taken from him and stolen, but from modesty. Sometimes he goes to
the window, and turning his back to his companions, puts something
on his breast, and bending his head, looks at it; if you go up to
him at such a moment, he is overcome with confusion and snatches
something off his breast. But it is not difficult to guess his
secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulate me,&rdquo; he often says to Ivan Dmitritch; &ldquo;I have been
presented with the Stanislav order of the second degree with the
star. The second degree with the star is only given to foreigners,
but for some reason they want to make an exception for me,&rdquo; he says
with a smile, shrugging his shoulders in perplexity. &ldquo;That I must
confess I did not expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand anything about that,&rdquo; Ivan Dmitritch replies
morosely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you know what I shall attain to sooner or later?&rdquo; the former
sorter persists, screwing up his eyes slyly. &ldquo;I shall certainly get
the Swedish &lsquo;Polar Star.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s an order it is worth working for,
a white cross with a black ribbon. It&rsquo;s very beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Probably in no other place is life so monotonous as in this ward.
In the morning the patients, except the paralytic and the fat
peasant, wash in the entry at a big tab and wipe themselves with
the skirts of their dressing-gowns; after that they drink tea out
of tin mugs which Nikita brings them out of the main building.
Everyone is allowed one mugful. At midday they have soup made out
of sour cabbage and boiled grain, in the evening their supper
consists of grain left from dinner. In the intervals they lie down,
sleep, look out of window, and walk from one corner to the other.
And so every day. Even the former sorter always talks of the same
orders.</p>
<p>Fresh faces are rarely seen in Ward No. 6. The doctor has not taken
in any new mental cases for a long time, and the people who are
fond of visiting lunatic asylums are few in this world. Once every
two months Semyon Lazaritch, the barber, appears in the ward. How
he cuts the patients&rsquo; hair, and how Nikita helps him to do it, and
what a trepidation the lunatics are always thrown into by the arrival
of the drunken, smiling barber, we will not describe.</p>
<p>No one even looks into the ward except the barber. The patients are
condemned to see day after day no one but Nikita.</p>
<p>A rather strange rumour has, however, been circulating in the
hospital of late.</p>
<p>It is rumoured that the doctor has begun to visit Ward No. 6.</p>
<h2>V</h2>
<p>A strange rumour!</p>
<p>Dr. Andrey Yefimitch Ragin is a strange man in his way. They say
that when he was young he was very religious, and prepared himself
for a clerical career, and that when he had finished his studies
at the high school in 1863 he intended to enter a theological
academy, but that his father, a surgeon and doctor of medicine,
jeered at him and declared point-blank that he would disown him if
he became a priest. How far this is true I don&rsquo;t know, but Andrey
Yefimitch himself has more than once confessed that he has never
had a natural bent for medicine or science in general.</p>
<p>However that may have been, when he finished his studies in the
medical faculty he did not enter the priesthood. He showed no special
devoutness, and was no more like a priest at the beginning of his
medical career than he is now.</p>
<p>His exterior is heavy&ndash;coarse like a peasant&rsquo;s, his face, his
beard, his flat hair, and his coarse, clumsy figure, suggest an
overfed, intemperate, and harsh innkeeper on the highroad. His face
is surly-looking and covered with blue veins, his eyes are little
and his nose is red. With his height and broad shoulders he has
huge hands and feet; one would think that a blow from his fist would
knock the life out of anyone, but his step is soft, and his walk
is cautious and insinuating; when he meets anyone in a narrow passage
he is always the first to stop and make way, and to say, not in a
bass, as one would expect, but in a high, soft tenor: &ldquo;I beg your
pardon!&rdquo; He has a little swelling on his neck which prevents him
from wearing stiff starched collars, and so he always goes about
in soft linen or cotton shirts. Altogether he does not dress like
a doctor. He wears the same suit for ten years, and the new clothes,
which he usually buys at a Jewish shop, look as shabby and crumpled
on him as his old ones; he sees patients and dines and pays visits
all in the same coat; but this is not due to niggardliness, but to
complete carelessness about his appearance.</p>
<p>When Andrey Yefimitch came to the town to take up his duties the
&ldquo;institution founded to the glory of God&rdquo; was in a terrible condition.
One could hardly breathe for the stench in the wards, in the passages,
and in the courtyards of the hospital. The hospital servants, the
nurses, and their children slept in the wards together with the
patients. They complained that there was no living for beetles,
bugs, and mice. The surgical wards were never free from erysipelas.
There were only two scalpels and not one thermometer in the whole
hospital; potatoes were kept in the baths. The superintendent, the
housekeeper, and the medical assistant robbed the patients, and of
the old doctor, Andrey Yefimitch&rsquo;s predecessor, people declared
that he secretly sold the hospital alcohol, and that he kept a
regular harem consisting of nurses and female patients. These
disorderly proceedings were perfectly well known in the town, and
were even exaggerated, but people took them calmly; some justified
them on the ground that there were only peasants and working men
in the hospital, who could not be dissatisfied, since they were
much worse off at home than in the hospital&ndash;they couldn&rsquo;t be fed
on woodcocks! Others said in excuse that the town alone, without
help from the Zemstvo, was not equal to maintaining a good hospital;
thank God for having one at all, even a poor one. And the newly
formed Zemstvo did not open infirmaries either in the town or the
neighbourhood, relying on the fact that the town already had its
hospital.</p>
<p>After looking over the hospital Andrey Yefimitch came to the
conclusion that it was an immoral institution and extremely prejudicial
to the health of the townspeople. In his opinion the most sensible
thing that could be done was to let out the patients and close the
hospital. But he reflected that his will alone was not enough to
do this, and that it would be useless; if physical and moral impurity
were driven out of one place, they would only move to another; one
must wait for it to wither away of itself. Besides, if people open
a hospital and put up with having it, it must be because they need
it; superstition and all the nastiness and abominations of daily
life were necessary, since in process of time they worked out to
something sensible, just as manure turns into black earth. There
was nothing on earth so good that it had not something nasty about
its first origin.</p>
<p>When Andrey Yefimitch undertook his duties he was apparently not
greatly concerned about the irregularities at the hospital. He only
asked the attendants and nurses not to sleep in the wards, and had
two cupboards of instruments put up; the superintendent, the
housekeeper, the medical assistant, and the erysipelas remained
unchanged.</p>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch loved intelligence and honesty intensely, but he
had no strength of will nor belief in his right to organize an
intelligent and honest life about him. He was absolutely unable to
give orders, to forbid things, and to insist. It seemed as though
he had taken a vow never to raise his voice and never to make use
of the imperative. It was difficult for him to say &ldquo;Fetch&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Bring&rdquo;; when he wanted his meals he would cough hesitatingly and
say to the cook, &ldquo;How about tea?. . .&rdquo; or &ldquo;How about dinner? . . .&rdquo;
To dismiss the superintendent or to tell him to leave off stealing,
or to abolish the unnecessary parasitic post altogether, was
absolutely beyond his powers. When Andrey Yefimitch was deceived
or flattered, or accounts he knew to be cooked were brought him to
sign, he would turn as red as a crab and feel guilty, but yet he
would sign the accounts. When the patients complained to him of
being hungry or of the roughness of the nurses, he would be confused
and mutter guiltily: &ldquo;Very well, very well, I will go into it later
. . . . Most likely there is some misunderstanding. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first Andrey Yefimitch worked very zealously. He saw patients
every day from morning till dinner-time, performed operations, and
even attended confinements. The ladies said of him that he was
attentive and clever at diagnosing diseases, especially those of
women and children. But in process of time the work unmistakably
wearied him by its monotony and obvious uselessness. To-day one
sees thirty patients, and to-morrow they have increased to thirty-five,
the next day forty, and so on from day to day, from year to year,
while the mortality in the town did not decrease and the patients
did not leave off coming. To be any real help to forty patients
between morning and dinner was not physically possible, so it could
but lead to deception. If twelve thousand patients were seen in a
year it meant, if one looked at it simply, that twelve thousand men
were deceived. To put those who were seriously ill into wards, and
to treat them according to the principles of science, was impossible,
too, because though there were principles there was no science; if
he were to put aside philosophy and pedantically follow the rules
as other doctors did, the things above all necessary were cleanliness
and ventilation instead of dirt, wholesome nourishment instead of
broth made of stinking, sour cabbage, and good assistants instead
of thieves; and, indeed, why hinder people dying if death is the
normal and legitimate end of everyone? What is gained if some
shop-keeper or clerk lives an extra five or ten years? If the aim
of medicine is by drugs to alleviate suffering, the question forces
itself on one: why alleviate it? In the first place, they say that
suffering leads man to perfection; and in the second, if mankind
really learns to alleviate its sufferings with pills and drops, it
will completely abandon religion and philosophy, in which it has
hitherto found not merely protection from all sorts of trouble, but
even happiness. Pushkin suffered terrible agonies before his death,
poor Heine lay paralyzed for several years; why, then, should not
some Andrey Yefimitch or Matryona Savishna be ill, since their lives
had nothing of importance in them, and would have been entirely
empty and like the life of an amoeba except for suffering?</p>
<p>Oppressed by such reflections, Andrey Yefimitch relaxed his efforts
and gave up visiting the hospital every day.</p>
<h2>VI</h2>
<p>His life was passed like this. As a rule he got up at eight o&rsquo;clock
in the morning, dressed, and drank his tea. Then he sat down in his
study to read, or went to the hospital. At the hospital the
out-patients were sitting in the dark, narrow little corridor waiting
to be seen by the doctor. The nurses and the attendants, tramping
with their boots over the brick floors, ran by them; gaunt-looking
patients in dressing-gowns passed; dead bodies and vessels full of
filth were carried by; the children were crying, and there was a
cold draught. Andrey Yefimitch knew that such surroundings were
torture to feverish, consumptive, and impressionable patients; but
what could be done? In the consulting-room he was met by his
assistant, Sergey Sergeyitch&ndash;a fat little man with a plump,
well-washed shaven face, with soft, smooth manners, wearing a new
loosely cut suit, and looking more like a senator than a medical
assistant. He had an immense practice in the town, wore a white
tie, and considered himself more proficient than the doctor, who
had no practice. In the corner of the consulting-room there stood
a large ikon in a shrine with a heavy lamp in front of it, and near
it a candle-stand with a white cover on it. On the walls hung
portraits of bishops, a view of the Svyatogorsky Monastery, and
wreaths of dried cornflowers. Sergey Sergeyitch was religious, and
liked solemnity and decorum. The ikon had been put up at his expense;
at his instructions some one of the patients read the hymns of
praise in the consulting-room on Sundays, and after the reading
Sergey Sergeyitch himself went through the wards with a censer and
burned incense.</p>
<p>There were a great many patients, but the time was short, and so
the work was confined to the asking of a few brief questions and
the administration of some drugs, such as castor-oil or volatile
ointment. Andrey Yefimitch would sit with his cheek resting in his
hand, lost in thought and asking questions mechanically. Sergey
Sergeyitch sat down too, rubbing his hands, and from time to time
putting in his word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We suffer pain and poverty,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;because we do not pray
to the merciful God as we should. Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch never performed any operation when he was seeing
patients; he had long ago given up doing so, and the sight of blood
upset him. When he had to open a child&rsquo;s mouth in order to look at
its throat, and the child cried and tried to defend itself with its
little hands, the noise in his ears made his head go round and
brought tears to his eyes. He would make haste to prescribe a drug,
and motion to the woman to take the child away.</p>
<p>He was soon wearied by the timidity of the patients and their
incoherence, by the proximity of the pious Sergey Sergeyitch, by
the portraits on the walls, and by his own questions which he had
asked over and over again for twenty years. And he would go away
after seeing five or six patients. The rest would be seen by his
assistant in his absence.</p>
<p>With the agreeable thought that, thank God, he had no private
practice now, and that no one would interrupt him, Andrey Yefimitch
sat down to the table immediately on reaching home and took up a
book. He read a great deal and always with enjoyment. Half his
salary went on buying books, and of the six rooms that made up his
abode three were heaped up with books and old magazines. He liked
best of all works on history and philosophy; the only medical
publication to which he subscribed was <em>The Doctor</em>, of which he
always read the last pages first. He would always go on reading for
several hours without a break and without being weary. He did not
read as rapidly and impulsively as Ivan Dmitritch had done in the
past, but slowly and with concentration, often pausing over a passage
which he liked or did not find intelligible. Near the books there
always stood a decanter of vodka, and a salted cucumber or a pickled
apple lay beside it, not on a plate, but on the baize table-cloth.
Every half-hour he would pour himself out a glass of vodka and drink
it without taking his eyes off the book. Then without looking at
it he would feel for the cucumber and bite off a bit.</p>
<p>At three o&rsquo;clock he would go cautiously to the kitchen door; cough,
and say, &ldquo;Daryushka, what about dinner? . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>After his dinner&ndash;a rather poor and untidily served one&ndash;Andrey
Yefimitch would walk up and down his rooms with his arms folded,
thinking. The clock would strike four, then five, and still he would
be walking up and down thinking. Occasionally the kitchen door would
creak, and the red and sleepy face of Daryushka would appear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andrey Yefimitch, isn&rsquo;t it time for you to have your beer?&rdquo; she
would ask anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not time yet . . .&rdquo; he would answer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait a little
. . . . I&rsquo;ll wait a little. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Towards the evening the postmaster, Mihail Averyanitch, the only
man in town whose society did not bore Andrey Yefimitch, would come
in. Mihail Averyanitch had once been a very rich landowner, and had
served in the calvary, but had come to ruin, and was forced by
poverty to take a job in the post office late in life. He had a
hale and hearty appearance, luxuriant grey whiskers, the manners
of a well-bred man, and a loud, pleasant voice. He was good-natured
and emotional, but hot-tempered. When anyone in the post office
made a protest, expressed disagreement, or even began to argue,
Mihail Averyanitch would turn crimson, shake all over, and shout
in a voice of thunder, &ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo; so that the post office
had long enjoyed the reputation of an institution which it was
terrible to visit. Mihail Averyanitch liked and respected Andrey
Yefimitch for his culture and the loftiness of his soul; he treated
the other inhabitants of the town superciliously, as though they
were his subordinates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; he would say, going in to Andrey Yefimitch. &ldquo;Good
evening, my dear fellow! I&rsquo;ll be bound, you are getting sick of me,
aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, I am delighted,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I am always
glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The friends would sit on the sofa in the study and for some time
would smoke in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daryushka, what about the beer?&rdquo; Andrey Yefimitch would say.</p>
<p>They would drink their first bottle still in silence, the doctor
brooding and Mihail Averyanitch with a gay and animated face, like
a man who has something very interesting to tell. The doctor was
always the one to begin the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity,&rdquo; he would say quietly and slowly, not looking his
friend in the face (he never looked anyone in the face)&ndash;&ldquo;what a
great pity it is that there are no people in our town who are capable
of carrying on intelligent and interesting conversation, or care
to do so. It is an immense privation for us. Even the educated class
do not rise above vulgarity; the level of their development, I
assure you, is not a bit higher than that of the lower orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly true. I agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, of course,&rdquo; the doctor went on quietly and deliberately,
&ldquo;that everything in this world is insignificant and uninteresting
except the higher spiritual manifestations of the human mind.
Intellect draws a sharp line between the animals and man, suggests
the divinity of the latter, and to some extent even takes the place
of the immortality which does not exist. Consequently the intellect
is the only possible source of enjoyment. We see and hear of no
trace of intellect about us, so we are deprived of enjoyment. We
have books, it is true, but that is not at all the same as living
talk and converse. If you will allow me to make a not quite apt
comparison: books are the printed score, while talk is the singing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A silence would follow. Daryushka would come out of the kitchen and
with an expression of blank dejection would stand in the doorway
to listen, with her face propped on her fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; Mihail Averyanitch would sigh. &ldquo;To expect intelligence of
this generation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he would describe how wholesome, entertaining, and interesting
life had been in the past. How intelligent the educated class in
Russia used to be, and what lofty ideas it had of honour and
friendship; how they used to lend money without an IOU, and it was
thought a disgrace not to give a helping hand to a comrade in need;
and what campaigns, what adventures, what skirmishes, what comrades,
what women! And the Caucasus, what a marvellous country! The wife
of a battalion commander, a queer woman, used to put on an officer&rsquo;s
uniform and drive off into the mountains in the evening, alone,
without a guide. It was said that she had a love affair with some
princeling in the native village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queen of Heaven, Holy Mother&hellip;&rdquo; Daryushka would sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how we drank! And how we ate! And what desperate liberals we
were!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch would listen without hearing; he was musing as he
sipped his beer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I often dream of intellectual people and conversation with them,&rdquo;
he said suddenly, interrupting Mihail Averyanitch. &ldquo;My father gave
me an excellent education, but under the influence of the ideas of
the sixties made me become a doctor. I believe if I had not obeyed
him then, by now I should have been in the very centre of the
intellectual movement. Most likely I should have become a member
of some university. Of course, intellect, too, is transient and not
eternal, but you know why I cherish a partiality for it. Life is a
vexatious trap; when a thinking man reaches maturity and attains
to full consciousness he cannot help feeling that he is in a trap
from which there is no escape. Indeed, he is summoned without his
choice by fortuitous circumstances from non-existence into life
. . . what for? He tries to find out the meaning and object of his
existence; he is told nothing, or he is told absurdities; he knocks
and it is not opened to him; death comes to him&ndash;also without his
choice. And so, just as in prison men held together by common
misfortune feel more at ease when they are together, so one does
not notice the trap in life when people with a bent for analysis
and generalization meet together and pass their time in the interchange
of proud and free ideas. In that sense the intellect is the source
of an enjoyment nothing can replace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not looking his friend in the face, Andrey Yefimitch would go on,
quietly and with pauses, talking about intellectual people and
conversation with them, and Mihail Averyanitch would listen attentively
and agree: &ldquo;Perfectly true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you do not believe in the immortality of the soul?&rdquo; he would
ask suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, honoured Mihail Averyanitch; I do not believe it, and have no
grounds for believing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must own I doubt it too. And yet I have a feeling as though I
should never die. Oh, I think to myself: &lsquo;Old fogey, it is time you
were dead!&rsquo; But there is a little voice in my soul says: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
believe it; you won&rsquo;t die.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after nine o&rsquo;clock Mihail Averyanitch would go away. As he put
on his fur coat in the entry he would say with a sigh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a wilderness fate has carried us to, though, really! What&rsquo;s
most vexatious of all is to have to die here. Ech! . .&rdquo;</p>
<h2>VII</h2>
<p>After seeing his friend out Andrey Yefimitch would sit down at the
table and begin reading again. The stillness of the evening, and
afterwards of the night, was not broken by a single sound, and it
seemed as though time were standing still and brooding with the
doctor over the book, and as though there were nothing in existence
but the books and the lamp with the green shade. The doctor&rsquo;s coarse
peasant-like face was gradually lighted up by a smile of delight
and enthusiasm over the progress of the human intellect. Oh, why
is not man immortal? he thought. What is the good of the brain
centres and convolutions, what is the good of sight, speech,
self-consciousness, genius, if it is all destined to depart into
the soil, and in the end to grow cold together with the earth&rsquo;s
crust, and then for millions of years to fly with the earth round
the sun with no meaning and no object? To do that there was no need
at all to draw man with his lofty, almost godlike intellect out of
non-existence, and then, as though in mockery, to turn him into
clay. The transmutation of substances! But what cowardice to comfort
oneself with that cheap substitute for immortality! The unconscious
processes that take place in nature are lower even than the stupidity
of man, since in stupidity there is, anyway, consciousness and will,
while in those processes there is absolutely nothing. Only the
coward who has more fear of death than dignity can comfort himself
with the fact that his body will in time live again in the grass,
in the stones, in the toad. To find one&rsquo;s immortality in the
transmutation of substances is as strange as to prophesy a brilliant
future for the case after a precious violin has been broken and
become useless.</p>
<p>When the clock struck, Andrey Yefimitch would sink back into his
chair and close his eyes to think a little. And under the influence
of the fine ideas of which he had been reading he would, unawares,
recall his past and his present. The past was hateful&ndash;better not
to think of it. And it was the same in the present as in the past.
He knew that at the very time when his thoughts were floating
together with the cooling earth round the sun, in the main building
beside his abode people were suffering in sickness and physical
impurity: someone perhaps could not sleep and was making war upon
the insects, someone was being infected by erysipelas, or moaning
over too tight a bandage; perhaps the patients were playing cards
with the nurses and drinking vodka. According to the yearly return,
twelve thousand people had been deceived; the whole hospital rested
as it had done twenty years ago on thieving, filth, scandals, gossip,
on gross quackery, and, as before, it was an immoral institution
extremely injurious to the health of the inhabitants. He knew that
Nikita knocked the patients about behind the barred windows of Ward
No. 6, and that Moiseika went about the town every day begging alms.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he knew very well that a magical change had taken
place in medicine during the last twenty-five years. When he was
studying at the university he had fancied that medicine would soon
be overtaken by the fate of alchemy and metaphysics; but now when
he was reading at night the science of medicine touched him and
excited his wonder, and even enthusiasm. What unexpected brilliance,
what a revolution! Thanks to the antiseptic system operations were
performed such as the great Pirogov had considered impossible even
<em>in spe</em>. Ordinary Zemstvo doctors were venturing to perform the
resection of the kneecap; of abdominal operations only one per cent.
was fatal; while stone was considered such a trifle that they did
not even write about it. A radical cure for syphilis had been
discovered. And the theory of heredity, hypnotism, the discoveries
of Pasteur and of Koch, hygiene based on statistics, and the work
of Zemstvo doctors!</p>
<p>Psychiatry with its modern classification of mental diseases, methods
of diagnosis, and treatment, was a perfect Elborus in comparison
with what had been in the past. They no longer poured cold water
on the heads of lunatics nor put strait-waistcoats upon them; they
treated them with humanity, and even, so it was stated in the papers,
got up balls and entertainments for them. Andrey Yefimitch knew
that with modern tastes and views such an abomination as Ward No.
6 was possible only a hundred and fifty miles from a railway in a
little town where the mayor and all the town council were half-illiterate
tradesmen who looked upon the doctor as an oracle who must be
believed without any criticism even if he had poured molten lead
into their mouths; in any other place the public and the newspapers
would long ago have torn this little Bastille to pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, after all, what of it?&rdquo; Andrey Yefimitch would ask himself,
opening his eyes. &ldquo;There is the antiseptic system, there is Koch,
there is Pasteur, but the essential reality is not altered a bit;
ill-health and mortality are still the same. They get up balls and
entertainments for the mad, but still they don&rsquo;t let them go free;
so it&rsquo;s all nonsense and vanity, and there is no difference in
reality between the best Vienna clinic and my hospital.&rdquo; But
depression and a feeling akin to envy prevented him from feeling
indifferent; it must have been owing to exhaustion. His heavy head
sank on to the book, he put his hands under his face to make it
softer, and thought: &ldquo;I serve in a pernicious institution and receive
a salary from people whom I am deceiving. I am not honest, but then,
I of myself am nothing, I am only part of an inevitable social evil:
all local officials are pernicious and receive their salary for
doing nothing. . . . And so for my dishonesty it is not I who am
to blame, but the times.... If I had been born two hundred years
later I should have been different. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>When it struck three he would put out his lamp and go into his
bedroom; he was not sleepy.</p>
<h2>VIII</h2>
<p>Two years before, the Zemstvo in a liberal mood had decided to allow
three hundred roubles a year to pay for additional medical service
in the town till the Zemstvo hospital should be opened, and the
district doctor, Yevgeny Fyodoritch Hobotov, was invited to the
town to assist Andrey Yefimitch. He was a very young man&ndash;not yet
thirty&ndash;tall and dark, with broad cheek-bones and little eyes;
his forefathers had probably come from one of the many alien races
of Russia. He arrived in the town without a farthing, with a small
portmanteau, and a plain young woman whom he called his cook. This
woman had a baby at the breast. Yevgeny Fyodoritch used to go about
in a cap with a peak, and in high boots, and in the winter wore a
sheepskin. He made great friends with Sergey Sergeyitch, the medical
assistant, and with the treasurer, but held aloof from the other
officials, and for some reason called them aristocrats. He had only
one book in his lodgings, &ldquo;The Latest Prescriptions of the Vienna
Clinic for 1881.&rdquo; When he went to a patient he always took this
book with him. He played billiards in the evening at the club: he
did not like cards. He was very fond of using in conversation such
expressions as &ldquo;endless bobbery,&rdquo; &ldquo;canting soft soap,&rdquo; &ldquo;shut up
with your finicking. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He visited the hospital twice a week, made the round of the wards,
and saw out-patients. The complete absence of antiseptic treatment
and the cupping roused his indignation, but he did not introduce
any new system, being afraid of offending Andrey Yefimitch. He
regarded his colleague as a sly old rascal, suspected him of being
a man of large means, and secretly envied him. He would have been
very glad to have his post.</p>
<h2>IX</h2>
<p>On a spring evening towards the end of March, when there was no
snow left on the ground and the starlings were singing in the
hospital garden, the doctor went out to see his friend the postmaster
as far as the gate. At that very moment the Jew Moiseika, returning
with his booty, came into the yard. He had no cap on, and his bare
feet were thrust into goloshes; in his hand he had a little bag of
coppers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a kopeck!&rdquo; he said to the doctor, smiling, and shivering
with cold. Andrey Yefimitch, who could never refuse anyone anything,
gave him a ten-kopeck piece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How bad that is!&rdquo; he thought, looking at the Jew&rsquo;s bare feet with
their thin red ankles. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s wet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And stirred by a feeling akin both to pity and disgust, he went
into the lodge behind the Jew, looking now at his bald head, now
at his ankles. As the doctor went in, Nikita jumped up from his
heap of litter and stood at attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-day, Nikita,&rdquo; Andrey Yefimitch said mildly. &ldquo;That Jew should
be provided with boots or something, he will catch cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, your honour. I&rsquo;ll inform the superintendent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do; ask him in my name. Tell him that I asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door into the ward was open. Ivan Dmitritch, lying propped on
his elbow on the bed, listened in alarm to the unfamiliar voice,
and suddenly recognized the doctor. He trembled all over with anger,
jumped up, and with a red and wrathful face, with his eyes starting
out of his head, ran out into the middle of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor has come!&rdquo; he shouted, and broke into a laugh. &ldquo;At last!
Gentlemen, I congratulate you. The doctor is honouring us with a
visit! Cursed reptile!&rdquo; he shrieked, and stamped in a frenzy such
as had never been seen in the ward before. &ldquo;Kill the reptile! No,
killing&rsquo;s too good. Drown him in the midden-pit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch, hearing this, looked into the ward from the entry
and asked gently: &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; shouted Ivan Dmitritch, going up to him with a menacing
air and convulsively wrapping himself in his dressing-gown. &ldquo;What
for? Thief!&rdquo; he said with a look of repulsion, moving his lips as
though he would spit at him. &ldquo;Quack! hangman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm yourself,&rdquo; said Andrey Yefimitch, smiling guiltily. &ldquo;I assure
you I have never stolen anything; and as to the rest, most likely
you greatly exaggerate. I see you are angry with me. Calm yourself,
I beg, if you can, and tell me coolly what are you angry for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you keeping me here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you are ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am ill. But you know dozens, hundreds of madmen are walking
about in freedom because your ignorance is incapable of distinguishing
them from the sane. Why am I and these poor wretches to be shut up
here like scapegoats for all the rest? You, your assistant, the
superintendent, and all your hospital rabble, are immeasurably
inferior to every one of us morally; why then are we shut up and
you not? Where&rsquo;s the logic of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morality and logic don&rsquo;t come in, it all depends on chance. If
anyone is shut up he has to stay, and if anyone is not shut up he
can walk about, that&rsquo;s all. There is neither morality nor logic in
my being a doctor and your being a mental patient, there is nothing
but idle chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That twaddle I don&rsquo;t understand. . .&rdquo; Ivan Dmitritch brought out
in a hollow voice, and he sat down on his bed.</p>
<p>Moiseika, whom Nikita did not venture to search in the presence of
the doctor, laid out on his bed pieces of bread, bits of paper, and
little bones, and, still shivering with cold, began rapidly in a
singsong voice saying something in Yiddish. He most likely imagined
that he had opened a shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me out,&rdquo; said Ivan Dmitritch, and his voice quivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why, why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it is not in my power. Think, what use will it be to you
if I do let you out? Go. The townspeople or the police will detain
you or bring you back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Ivan Dmitritch, and he rubbed his
forehead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful! But what am I to do, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch liked Ivan Dmitritch&rsquo;s voice and his intelligent
young face with its grimaces. He longed to be kind to the young man
and soothe him; he sat down on the bed beside him, thought, and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask me what to do. The very best thing in your position would
be to run away. But, unhappily, that is useless. You would be taken
up. When society protects itself from the criminal, mentally deranged,
or otherwise inconvenient people, it is invincible. There is only
one thing left for you: to resign yourself to the thought that your
presence here is inevitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no use to anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as prisons and madhouses exist someone must be shut up in
them. If not you, I. If not I, some third person. Wait till in the
distant future prisons and madhouses no longer exist, and there
will be neither bars on the windows nor hospital gowns. Of course,
that time will come sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ivan Dmitritch smiled ironically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are jesting,&rdquo; he said, screwing up his eyes. &ldquo;Such gentlemen
as you and your assistant Nikita have nothing to do with the future,
but you may be sure, sir, better days will come! I may express
myself cheaply, you may laugh, but the dawn of a new life is at
hand; truth and justice will triumph, and&ndash;our turn will come! I
shall not live to see it, I shall perish, but some people&rsquo;s
great-grandsons will see it. I greet them with all my heart and
rejoice, rejoice with them! Onward! God be your help, friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With shining eyes Ivan Dmitritch got up, and stretching his hands
towards the window, went on with emotion in his voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;From behind these bars I bless you! Hurrah for truth and justice!
I rejoice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see no particular reason to rejoice,&rdquo; said Andrey Yefimitch, who
thought Ivan Dmitritch&rsquo;s movement theatrical, though he was delighted
by it. &ldquo;Prisons and madhouses there will not be, and truth, as you
have just expressed it, will triumph; but the reality of things,
you know, will not change, the laws of nature will still remain the
same. People will suffer pain, grow old, and die just as they do
now. However magnificent a dawn lighted up your life, you would yet
in the end be nailed up in a coffin and thrown into a hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And immortality?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in it, but I do. Somebody in Dostoevsky or
Voltaire said that if there had not been a God men would have
invented him. And I firmly believe that if there is no immortality
the great intellect of man will sooner or later invent it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well said,&rdquo; observed Andrey Yefimitch, smiling with pleasure; its
a good thing you have faith. With such a belief one may live happily
even shut up within walls. You have studied somewhere, I presume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have been at the university, but did not complete my studies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a reflecting and a thoughtful man. In any surroundings you
can find tranquillity in yourself. Free and deep thinking which
strives for the comprehension of life, and complete contempt for
the foolish bustle of the world&ndash;those are two blessings beyond
any that man has ever known. And you can possess them even though
you lived behind threefold bars. Diogenes lived in a tub, yet he
was happier than all the kings of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Diogenes was a blockhead,&rdquo; said Ivan Dmitritch morosely. &ldquo;Why
do you talk to me about Diogenes and some foolish comprehension of
life?&rdquo; he cried, growing suddenly angry and leaping up. &ldquo;I love
life; I love it passionately. I have the mania of persecution, a
continual agonizing terror; but I have moments when I am overwhelmed
by the thirst for life, and then I am afraid of going mad. I want
dreadfully to live, dreadfully!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked up and down the ward in agitation, and said, dropping his
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I dream I am haunted by phantoms. People come to me, I hear
voices and music, and I fancy I am walking through woods or by the
seashore, and I long so passionately for movement, for interests
. . . . Come, tell me, what news is there?&rdquo; asked Ivan Dmitritch;
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to know about the town or in general?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, tell me first about the town, and then in general.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in the town it is appallingly dull. . . . There&rsquo;s no one to
say a word to, no one to listen to. There are no new people. A young
doctor called Hobotov has come here recently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had come in my time. Well, he is a low cad, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is a man of no culture. It&rsquo;s strange, you know. . . .
Judging by every sign, there is no intellectual stagnation in our
capital cities; there is a movement&ndash;so there must be real people
there too; but for some reason they always send us such men as I
would rather not see. It&rsquo;s an unlucky town!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is an unlucky town,&rdquo; sighed Ivan Dmitritch, and he laughed.
&ldquo;And how are things in general? What are they writing in the papers
and reviews?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was by now dark in the ward. The doctor got up, and, standing,
began to describe what was being written abroad and in Russia, and
the tendency of thought that could be noticed now. Ivan Dmitritch
listened attentively and put questions, but suddenly, as though
recalling something terrible, clutched at his head and lay down on
the bed with his back to the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Andrey Yefimitch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not hear another word from me,&rdquo; said Ivan Dmitritch rudely.
&ldquo;Leave me alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, leave me alone. Why the devil do you persist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch shrugged his shoulders, heaved a sigh, and went
out. As he crossed the entry he said: &ldquo;You might clear up here,
Nikita . . . there&rsquo;s an awfully stuffy smell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, your honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an agreeable young man!&rdquo; thought Andrey Yefimitch, going back
to his flat. &ldquo;In all the years I have been living here I do believe
he is the first I have met with whom one can talk. He is capable
of reasoning and is interested in just the right things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was reading, and afterwards, while he was going to bed,
he kept thinking about Ivan Dmitritch, and when he woke next morning
he remembered that he had the day before made the acquaintance of
an intelligent and interesting man, and determined to visit him
again as soon as possible.</p>
<h2>X</h2>
<p>Ivan Dmitritch was lying in the same position as on the previous
day, with his head clutched in both hands and his legs drawn up.
His face was not visible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-day, my friend,&rdquo; said Andrey Yefimitch. &ldquo;You are not asleep,
are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, I am not your friend,&rdquo; Ivan Dmitritch articulated
into the pillow; &ldquo;and in the second, your efforts are useless; you
will not get one word out of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; muttered Andrey Yefimitch in confusion. &ldquo;Yesterday we
talked peacefully, but suddenly for some reason you took offence
and broke off all at once. . . . Probably I expressed myself
awkwardly, or perhaps gave utterance to some idea which did not fit
in with your convictions. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a likely idea!&rdquo; said Ivan Dmitritch, sitting up and looking
at the doctor with irony and uneasiness. His eyes were red. &ldquo;You
can go and spy and probe somewhere else, it&rsquo;s no use your doing it
here. I knew yesterday what you had come for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange fancy,&rdquo; laughed the doctor. &ldquo;So you suppose me to be a
spy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. . . . A spy or a doctor who has been charged to test
me&ndash;it&rsquo;s all the same ----&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh excuse me, what a queer fellow you are really!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor sat down on the stool near the bed and shook his head
reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let us suppose you are right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let us suppose that
I am treacherously trying to trap you into saying something so as
to betray you to the police. You would be arrested and then tried.
But would you be any worse off being tried and in prison than you
are here? If you are banished to a settlement, or even sent to penal
servitude, would it be worse than being shut up in this ward? I
imagine it would be no worse. . . . What, then, are you afraid of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words evidently had an effect on Ivan Dmitritch. He sat down
quietly.</p>
<p>It was between four and five in the afternoon&ndash;the time when
Andrey Yefimitch usually walked up and down his rooms, and Daryushka
asked whether it was not time for his beer. It was a still, bright
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came out for a walk after dinner, and here I have come, as you
see,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;It is quite spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What month is it? March?&rdquo; asked Ivan Dmitritch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the end of March.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it very muddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not very. There are already paths in the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be nice now to drive in an open carriage somewhere into
the country,&rdquo; said Ivan Dmitritch, rubbing his red eyes as though
he were just awake, &ldquo;then to come home to a warm, snug study, and
. . . and to have a decent doctor to cure one&rsquo;s headache. . . .
It&rsquo;s so long since I have lived like a human being. It&rsquo;s disgusting
here! Insufferably disgusting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After his excitement of the previous day he was exhausted and
listless, and spoke unwillingly. His fingers twitched, and from his
face it could be seen that he had a splitting headache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no real difference between a warm, snug study and this
ward,&rdquo; said Andrey Yefimitch. &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s peace and contentment do not
lie outside a man, but in himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ordinary man looks for good and evil in external
things&ndash;that is, in carriages, in studies&ndash;but a thinking man looks for
it in himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should go and preach that philosophy in Greece, where it&rsquo;s
warm and fragrant with the scent of pomegranates, but here it is
not suited to the climate. With whom was it I was talking of Diogenes?
Was it with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, with me yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diogenes did not need a study or a warm habitation; it&rsquo;s hot there
without. You can lie in your tub and eat oranges and olives. But
bring him to Russia to live: he&rsquo;d be begging to be let indoors in
May, let alone December. He&rsquo;d be doubled up with the cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. One can be insensible to cold as to every other pain. Marcus
Aurelius says: &lsquo;A pain is a vivid idea of pain; make an effort of
will to change that idea, dismiss it, cease to complain, and the
pain will disappear.&rsquo; That is true. The wise man, or simply the
reflecting, thoughtful man, is distinguished precisely by his
contempt for suffering; he is always contented and surprised at
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I am an idiot, since I suffer and am discontented and surprised
at the baseness of mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are wrong in that; if you will reflect more on the subject you
will understand how insignificant is all that external world that
agitates us. One must strive for the comprehension of life, and in
that is true happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comprehension . . .&rdquo; repeated Ivan Dmitritch frowning. &ldquo;External,
internal. . . . Excuse me, but I don&rsquo;t understand it. I only know,&rdquo;
he said, getting up and looking angrily at the doctor&ndash;&ldquo;I only
know that God has created me of warm blood and nerves, yes, indeed!
If organic tissue is capable of life it must react to every stimulus.
And I do! To pain I respond with tears and outcries, to baseness
with indignation, to filth with loathing. To my mind, that is just
what is called life. The lower the organism, the less sensitive it
is, and the more feebly it reacts to stimulus; and the higher it
is, the more responsively and vigorously it reacts to reality. How
is it you don&rsquo;t know that? A doctor, and not know such trifles! To
despise suffering, to be always contented, and to be surprised at
nothing, one must reach this condition&rdquo;&ndash;and Ivan Dmitritch pointed
to the peasant who was a mass of fat&ndash;&ldquo;or to harden oneself by
suffering to such a point that one loses all sensibility to
it&ndash;that is, in other words, to cease to live. You must excuse me, I
am not a sage or a philosopher,&rdquo; Ivan Dmitritch continued with
irritation, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t understand anything about it. I am not
capable of reasoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, your reasoning is excellent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Stoics, whom you are parodying, were remarkable people, but
their doctrine crystallized two thousand years ago and has not
advanced, and will not advance, an inch forward, since it is not
practical or living. It had a success only with the minority which
spends its life in savouring all sorts of theories and ruminating
over them; the majority did not understand it. A doctrine which
advocates indifference to wealth and to the comforts of life, and
a contempt for suffering and death, is quite unintelligible to the
vast majority of men, since that majority has never known wealth
or the comforts of life; and to despise suffering would mean to it
despising life itself, since the whole existence of man is made up
of the sensations of hunger, cold, injury, and a Hamlet-like dread
of death. The whole of life lies in these sensations; one may be
oppressed by it, one may hate it, but one cannot despise it. Yes,
so, I repeat, the doctrine of the Stoics can never have a future;
from the beginning of time up to to-day you see continually increasing
the struggle, the sensibility to pain, the capacity of responding
to stimulus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ivan Dmitritch suddenly lost the thread of his thoughts, stopped,
and rubbed his forehead with vexation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant to say something important, but I have lost it,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;What was I saying? Oh, yes! This is what I mean: one of the Stoics
sold himself into slavery to redeem his neighbour, so, you see,
even a Stoic did react to stimulus, since, for such a generous act
as the destruction of oneself for the sake of one&rsquo;s neighbour, he
must have had a soul capable of pity and indignation. Here in prison
I have forgotten everything I have learned, or else I could have
recalled something else. Take Christ, for instance: Christ responded
to reality by weeping, smiling, being sorrowful and moved to wrath,
even overcome by misery. He did not go to meet His sufferings with
a smile, He did not despise death, but prayed in the Garden of
Gethsemane that this cup might pass Him by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ivan Dmitritch laughed and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granted that a man&rsquo;s peace and contentment lie not outside but in
himself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;granted that one must despise suffering and not
be surprised at anything, yet on what ground do you preach the
theory? Are you a sage? A philosopher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not a philosopher, but everyone ought to preach it because
it is reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I want to know how it is that you consider yourself competent
to judge of &lsquo;comprehension,&rsquo; contempt for suffering, and so on.
Have you ever suffered? Have you any idea of suffering? Allow me
to ask you, were you ever thrashed in your childhood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my parents had an aversion for corporal punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father used to flog me cruelly; my father was a harsh, sickly
Government clerk with a long nose and a yellow neck. But let us
talk of you. No one has laid a finger on you all your life, no one
has scared you nor beaten you; you are as strong as a bull. You
grew up under your father&rsquo;s wing and studied at his expense, and
then you dropped at once into a sinecure. For more than twenty years
you have lived rent free with heating, lighting, and service all
provided, and had the right to work how you pleased and as much as
you pleased, even to do nothing. You were naturally a flabby, lazy
man, and so you have tried to arrange your life so that nothing
should disturb you or make you move. You have handed over your work
to the assistant and the rest of the rabble while you sit in peace
and warmth, save money, read, amuse yourself with reflections, with
all sorts of lofty nonsense, and&rdquo; (Ivan Dmitritch looked at the
doctor&rsquo;s red nose) &ldquo;with boozing; in fact, you have seen nothing
of life, you know absolutely nothing of it, and are only theoretically
acquainted with reality; you despise suffering and are surprised
at nothing for a very simple reason: vanity of vanities, the external
and the internal, contempt for life, for suffering and for death,
comprehension, true happiness&ndash;that&rsquo;s the philosophy that suits
the Russian sluggard best. You see a peasant beating his wife, for
instance. Why interfere? Let him beat her, they will both die sooner
or later, anyway; and, besides, he who beats injures by his blows,
not the person he is beating, but himself. To get drunk is stupid
and unseemly, but if you drink you die, and if you don&rsquo;t drink you
die. A peasant woman comes with toothache . . . well, what of it?
Pain is the idea of pain, and besides &lsquo;there is no living in this
world without illness; we shall all die, and so, go away, woman,
don&rsquo;t hinder me from thinking and drinking vodka.&rsquo; A young man asks
advice, what he is to do, how he is to live; anyone else would think
before answering, but you have got the answer ready: strive for
&lsquo;comprehension&rsquo; or for true happiness. And what is that fantastic
&lsquo;true happiness&rsquo;? There&rsquo;s no answer, of course. We are kept here
behind barred windows, tortured, left to rot; but that is very good
and reasonable, because there is no difference at all between this
ward and a warm, snug study. A convenient philosophy. You can do
nothing, and your conscience is clear, and you feel you are wise
. . . . No, sir, it is not philosophy, it&rsquo;s not thinking, it&rsquo;s not
breadth of vision, but laziness, fakirism, drowsy stupefaction.
Yes,&rdquo; cried Ivan Dmitritch, getting angry again, &ldquo;you despise
suffering, but I&rsquo;ll be bound if you pinch your finger in the door
you will howl at the top of your voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t howl,&rdquo; said Andrey Yefimitch, with a gentle
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I dare say! Well, if you had a stroke of paralysis, or supposing
some fool or bully took advantage of his position and rank to insult
you in public, and if you knew he could do it with impunity, then
you would understand what it means to put people off with comprehension
and true happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s original,&rdquo; said Andrey Yefimitch, laughing with pleasure
and rubbing his hands. &ldquo;I am agreeably struck by your inclination
for drawing generalizations, and the sketch of my character you
have just drawn is simply brilliant. I must confess that talking
to you gives me great pleasure. Well, I&rsquo;ve listened to you, and now
you must graciously listen to me.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>XI</h2>
<p>The conversation went on for about an hour longer, and apparently
made a deep impression on Andrey Yefimitch. He began going to the
ward every day. He went there in the mornings and after dinner, and
often the dusk of evening found him in conversation with Ivan
Dmitritch. At first Ivan Dmitritch held aloof from him, suspected
him of evil designs, and openly expressed his hostility. But
afterwards he got used to him, and his abrupt manner changed to one
of condescending irony.</p>
<p>Soon it was all over the hospital that the doctor, Andrey Yefimitch,
had taken to visiting Ward No. 6. No one&ndash;neither Sergey Sergevitch,
nor Nikita, nor the nurses&ndash;could conceive why he went there, why
he stayed there for hours together, what he was talking about, and
why he did not write prescriptions. His actions seemed strange.
Often Mihail Averyanitch did not find him at home, which had never
happened in the past, and Daryushka was greatly perturbed, for the
doctor drank his beer now at no definite time, and sometimes was
even late for dinner.</p>
<p>One day&ndash;it was at the end of June&ndash;Dr. Hobotov went to see
Andrey Yefimitch about something. Not finding him at home, he
proceeded to look for him in the yard; there he was told that the
old doctor had gone to see the mental patients. Going into the lodge
and stopping in the entry, Hobotov heard the following conversation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall never agree, and you will not succeed in converting me
to your faith,&rdquo; Ivan Dmitritch was saying irritably; &ldquo;you are utterly
ignorant of reality, and you have never known suffering, but have
only like a leech fed beside the sufferings of others, while I have
been in continual suffering from the day of my birth till to-day.
For that reason, I tell you frankly, I consider myself superior to
you and more competent in every respect. It&rsquo;s not for you to teach
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have absolutely no ambition to convert you to my faith,&rdquo; said
Andrey Yefimitch gently, and with regret that the other refused to
understand him. &ldquo;And that is not what matters, my friend; what
matters is not that you have suffered and I have not. Joy and
suffering are passing; let us leave them, never mind them. What
matters is that you and I think; we see in each other people who
are capable of thinking and reasoning, and that is a common bond
between us however different our views. If you knew, my friend, how
sick I am of the universal senselessness, ineptitude, stupidity,
and with what delight I always talk with you! You are an intelligent
man, and I enjoyed your company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hobotov opened the door an inch and glanced into the ward; Ivan
Dmitritch in his night-cap and the doctor Andrey Yefimitch were
sitting side by side on the bed. The madman was grimacing, twitching,
and convulsively wrapping himself in his gown, while the doctor sat
motionless with bowed head, and his face was red and look helpless
and sorrowful. Hobotov shrugged his shoulders, grinned, and glanced
at Nikita. Nikita shrugged his shoulders too.</p>
<p>Next day Hobotov went to the lodge, accompanied by the assistant.
Both stood in the entry and listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy our old man has gone clean off his chump!&rdquo; said Hobotov
as he came out of the lodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord have mercy upon us sinners!&rdquo; sighed the decorous Sergey
Sergeyitch, scrupulously avoiding the puddles that he might not
muddy his polished boots. &ldquo;I must own, honoured Yevgeny Fyodoritch,
I have been expecting it for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>XII</h2>
<p>After this Andrey Yefimitch began to notice a mysterious air in all
around him. The attendants, the nurses, and the patients looked at
him inquisitively when they met him, and then whispered together.
The superintendent&rsquo;s little daughter Masha, whom he liked to meet
in the hospital garden, for some reason ran away from him now when
he went up with a smile to stroke her on the head. The postmaster
no longer said, &ldquo;Perfectly true,&rdquo; as he listened to him, but in
unaccountable confusion muttered, &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes . . .&rdquo; and looked
at him with a grieved and thoughtful expression; for some reason
he took to advising his friend to give up vodka and beer, but as a
man of delicate feeling he did not say this directly, but hinted
it, telling him first about the commanding officer of his battalion,
an excellent man, and then about the priest of the regiment, a
capital fellow, both of whom drank and fell ill, but on giving up
drinking completely regained their health. On two or three occasions
Andrey Yefimitch was visited by his colleague Hobotov, who also
advised him to give up spirituous liquors, and for no apparent
reason recommended him to take bromide.</p>
<p>In August Andrey Yefimitch got a letter from the mayor of the town
asking him to come on very important business. On arriving at the
town hall at the time fixed, Andrey Yefimitch found there the
military commander, the superintendent of the district school, a
member of the town council, Hobotov, and a plump, fair gentleman
who was introduced to him as a doctor. This doctor, with a Polish
surname difficult to pronounce, lived at a pedigree stud-farm twenty
miles away, and was now on a visit to the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something that concerns you,&rdquo; said the member of the town
council, addressing Andrey Yefimitch after they had all greeted one
another and sat down to the table. &ldquo;Here Yevgeny Fyodoritch says
that there is not room for the dispensary in the main building, and
that it ought to be transferred to one of the lodges. That&rsquo;s of no
consequence&ndash;of course it can be transferred, but the point is
that the lodge wants doing up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it would have to be done up,&rdquo; said Andrey Yefimitch after a
moment&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;If the corner lodge, for instance, were fitted
up as a dispensary, I imagine it would cost at least five hundred
roubles. An unproductive expenditure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was silent for a space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the honour of submitting to you ten years ago,&rdquo; Andrey
Yefimitch went on in a low voice, &ldquo;that the hospital in its present
form is a luxury for the town beyond its means. It was built in the
forties, but things were different then. The town spends too much
on unnecessary buildings and superfluous staff. I believe with a
different system two model hospitals might be maintained for the
same money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let us have a different system, then!&rdquo; the member of the
town council said briskly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already had the honour of submitting to you that the medical
department should be transferred to the supervision of the Zemstvo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, transfer the money to the Zemstvo and they will steal it,&rdquo;
laughed the fair-haired doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it always comes to,&rdquo; the member of the council assented,
and he also laughed.</p>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch looked with apathetic, lustreless eyes at the
fair-haired doctor and said: &ldquo;One should be just.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again there was silence. Tea was brought in. The military commander,
for some reason much embarrassed, touched Andrey Yefimitch&rsquo;s hand
across the table and said: &ldquo;You have quite forgotten us, doctor.
But of course you are a hermit: you don&rsquo;t play cards and don&rsquo;t like
women. You would be dull with fellows like us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all began saying how boring it was for a decent person to live
in such a town. No theatre, no music, and at the last dance at the
club there had been about twenty ladies and only two gentlemen. The
young men did not dance, but spent all the time crowding round the
refreshment bar or playing cards.</p>
<p>Not looking at anyone and speaking slowly in a low voice, Andrey
Yefimitch began saying what a pity, what a terrible pity it was
that the townspeople should waste their vital energy, their hearts,
and their minds on cards and gossip, and should have neither the
power nor the inclination to spend their time in interesting
conversation and reading, and should refuse to take advantage of
the enjoyments of the mind. The mind alone was interesting and
worthy of attention, all the rest was low and petty. Hobotov listened
to his colleague attentively and suddenly asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andrey Yefimitch, what day of the month is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having received an answer, the fair-haired doctor and he, in the
tone of examiners conscious of their lack of skill, began asking
Andrey Yefimitch what was the day of the week, how many days there
were in the year, and whether it was true that there was a remarkable
prophet living in Ward No. 6.</p>
<p>In response to the last question Andrey Yefimitch turned rather red
and said: &ldquo;Yes, he is mentally deranged, but he is an interesting
young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They asked him no other questions.</p>
<p>When he was putting on his overcoat in the entry, the military
commander laid a hand on his shoulder and said with a sigh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for us old fellows to rest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he came out of the hall, Andrey Yefimitch understood that it had
been a committee appointed to enquire into his mental condition.
He recalled the questions that had been asked him, flushed crimson,
and for some reason, for the first time in his life, felt bitterly
grieved for medical science.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God. . .&rdquo; he thought, remembering how these doctors had just
examined him; &ldquo;why, they have only lately been hearing lectures on
mental pathology; they had passed an examination&ndash;what&rsquo;s the
explanation of this crass ignorance? They have not a conception of
mental pathology!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And for the first time in his life he felt insulted and moved to
anger.</p>
<p>In the evening of the same day Mihail Averyanitch came to see him.
The postmaster went up to him without waiting to greet him, took
him by both hands, and said in an agitated voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, my dear friend, show me that you believe in my
genuine affection and look on me as your friend!&rdquo; And preventing
Andrey Yefimitch from speaking, he went on, growing excited: &ldquo;I
love you for your culture and nobility of soul. Listen to me, my
dear fellow. The rules of their profession compel the doctors to
conceal the truth from you, but I blurt out the plain truth like a
soldier. You are not well! Excuse me, my dear fellow, but it is the
truth; everyone about you has been noticing it for a long time. Dr.
Yevgeny Fyodoritch has just told me that it is essential for you
to rest and distract your mind for the sake of your health. Perfectly
true! Excellent! In a day or two I am taking a holiday and am going
away for a sniff of a different atmosphere. Show that you are a
friend to me, let us go together! Let us go for a jaunt as in the
good old days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel perfectly well,&rdquo; said Andrey Yefimitch after a moment&rsquo;s
thought. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go away. Allow me to show you my friendship in
some other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To go off with no object, without his books, without his Daryushka,
without his beer, to break abruptly through the routine of life,
established for twenty years&ndash;the idea for the first minute struck
him as wild and fantastic, but he remembered the conversation at
the Zemstvo committee and the depressing feelings with which he had
returned home, and the thought of a brief absence from the town in
which stupid people looked on him as a madman was pleasant to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where precisely do you intend to go?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Moscow, to Petersburg, to Warsaw. . . . I spent the five happiest
years of my life in Warsaw. What a marvellous town! Let us go, my
dear fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>XIII</h2>
<p>A week later it was suggested to Andrey Yefimitch that he should
have a rest&ndash;that is, send in his resignation&ndash;a suggestion he
received with indifference, and a week later still, Mihail Averyanitch
and he were sitting in a posting carriage driving to the nearest
railway station. The days were cool and bright, with a blue sky and
a transparent distance. They were two days driving the hundred and
fifty miles to the railway station, and stayed two nights on the
way. When at the posting station the glasses given them for their
tea had not been properly washed, or the drivers were slow in
harnessing the horses, Mihail Averyanitch would turn crimson, and
quivering all over would shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue! Don&rsquo;t argue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in the carriage he talked without ceasing for a moment, describing
his campaigns in the Caucasus and in Poland. What adventures he had
had, what meetings! He talked loudly and opened his eyes so wide
with wonder that he might well be thought to be lying. Moreover,
as he talked he breathed in Andrey Yefimitch&rsquo;s face and laughed
into his ear. This bothered the doctor and prevented him from
thinking or concentrating his mind.</p>
<p>In the train they travelled, from motives of economy, third-class
in a non-smoking compartment. Half the passengers were decent people.
Mihail Averyanitch soon made friends with everyone, and moving from
one seat to another, kept saying loudly that they ought not to
travel by these appalling lines. It was a regular swindle! A very
different thing riding on a good horse: one could do over seventy
miles a day and feel fresh and well after it. And our bad harvests
were due to the draining of the Pinsk marshes; altogether, the way
things were done was dreadful. He got excited, talked loudly, and
would not let others speak. This endless chatter to the accompaniment
of loud laughter and expressive gestures wearied Andrey Yefimitch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of us is the madman?&rdquo; he thought with vexation. &ldquo;I, who try
not to disturb my fellow-passengers in any way, or this egoist who
thinks that he is cleverer and more interesting than anyone here,
and so will leave no one in peace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Moscow Mihail Averyanitch put on a military coat without epaulettes
and trousers with red braid on them. He wore a military cap and
overcoat in the street, and soldiers saluted him. It seemed to
Andrey Yefimitch, now, that his companion was a man who had flung
away all that was good and kept only what was bad of all the
characteristics of a country gentleman that he had once possessed.
He liked to be waited on even when it was quite unnecessary. The
matches would be lying before him on the table, and he would see
them and shout to the waiter to give him the matches; he did not
hesitate to appear before a maidservant in nothing but his underclothes;
he used the familiar mode of address to all footmen indiscriminately,
even old men, and when he was angry called them fools and blockheads.
This, Andrey Yefimitch thought, was like a gentleman, but disgusting.</p>
<p>First of all Mihail Averyanitch led his friend to the Iversky
Madonna. He prayed fervently, shedding tears and bowing down to the
earth, and when he had finished, heaved a deep sigh and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even though one does not believe it makes one somehow easier when
one prays a little. Kiss the ikon, my dear fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch was embarrassed and he kissed the image, while
Mihail Averyanitch pursed up his lips and prayed in a whisper, and
again tears came into his eyes. Then they went to the Kremlin and
looked there at the Tsar-cannon and the Tsar-bell, and even touched
them with their fingers, admired the view over the river, visited
St. Saviour&rsquo;s and the Rumyantsev museum.</p>
<p>They dined at Tyestov&rsquo;s. Mihail Averyanitch looked a long time at
the menu, stroking his whiskers, and said in the tone of a gourmand
accustomed to dine in restaurants:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall see what you give us to eat to-day, angel!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>XIV</h2>
<p>The doctor walked about, looked at things, ate and drank, but he
had all the while one feeling: annoyance with Mihail Averyanitch.
He longed to have a rest from his friend, to get away from him, to
hide himself, while the friend thought it was his duty not to let
the doctor move a step away from him, and to provide him with as
many distractions as possible. When there was nothing to look at
he entertained him with conversation. For two days Andrey Yefimitch
endured it, but on the third he announced to his friend that he was
ill and wanted to stay at home for the whole day; his friend replied
that in that case he would stay too&ndash;that really he needed rest,
for he was run off his legs already. Andrey Yefimitch lay on the
sofa, with his face to the back, and clenching his teeth, listened
to his friend, who assured him with heat that sooner or later France
would certainly thrash Germany, that there were a great many
scoundrels in Moscow, and that it was impossible to judge of a
horse&rsquo;s quality by its outward appearance. The doctor began to have
a buzzing in his ears and palpitations of the heart, but out of
delicacy could not bring himself to beg his friend to go away or
hold his tongue. Fortunately Mihail Averyanitch grew weary of sitting
in the hotel room, and after dinner he went out for a walk.</p>
<p>As soon as he was alone Andrey Yefimitch abandoned himself to a
feeling of relief. How pleasant to lie motionless on the sofa and
to know that one is alone in the room! Real happiness is impossible
without solitude. The fallen angel betrayed God probably because
he longed for solitude, of which the angels know nothing. Andrey
Yefimitch wanted to think about what he had seen and heard during
the last few days, but he could not get Mihail Averyanitch out of
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he has taken a holiday and come with me out of friendship,
out of generosity,&rdquo; thought the doctor with vexation; &ldquo;nothing could
be worse than this friendly supervision. I suppose he is good-natured
and generous and a lively fellow, but he is a bore. An insufferable
bore. In the same way there are people who never say anything but
what is clever and good, yet one feels that they are dull-witted
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the following days Andrey Yefimitch declared himself ill and
would not leave the hotel room; he lay with his face to the back
of the sofa, and suffered agonies of weariness when his friend
entertained him with conversation, or rested when his friend was
absent. He was vexed with himself for having come, and with his
friend, who grew every day more talkative and more free-and-easy;
he could not succeed in attuning his thoughts to a serious and lofty
level.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what I get from the real life Ivan Dmitritch talked about,&rdquo;
he thought, angry at his own pettiness. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s of no consequence,
though. . . . I shall go home, and everything will go on as
before . . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the same thing in Petersburg too; for whole days together
he did not leave the hotel room, but lay on the sofa and only got
up to drink beer.</p>
<p>Mihail Averyanitch was all haste to get to Warsaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear man, what should I go there for?&rdquo; said Andrey Yefimitch
in an imploring voice. &ldquo;You go alone and let me get home! I entreat
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On no account,&rdquo; protested Mihail Averyanitch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a marvellous
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch had not the strength of will to insist on his own
way, and much against his inclination went to Warsaw. There he did
not leave the hotel room, but lay on the sofa, furious with himself,
with his friend, and with the waiters, who obstinately refused to
understand Russian; while Mihail Averyanitch, healthy, hearty, and
full of spirits as usual, went about the town from morning to night,
looking for his old acquaintances. Several times he did not return
home at night. After one night spent in some unknown haunt he
returned home early in the morning, in a violently excited condition,
with a red face and tousled hair. For a long time he walked up and
down the rooms muttering something to himself, then stopped and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honour before everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After walking up and down a little longer he clutched his head in
both hands and pronounced in a tragic voice: &ldquo;Yes, honour before
everything! Accursed be the moment when the idea first entered my
head to visit this Babylon! My dear friend,&rdquo; he added, addressing
the doctor, &ldquo;you may despise me, I have played and lost; lend me
five hundred roubles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch counted out five hundred roubles and gave them to
his friend without a word. The latter, still crimson with shame and
anger, incoherently articulated some useless vow, put on his cap,
and went out. Returning two hours later he flopped into an easy-chair,
heaved a loud sigh, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My honour is saved. Let us go, my friend; I do not care to remain
another hour in this accursed town. Scoundrels! Austrian spies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time the friends were back in their own town it was November,
and deep snow was lying in the streets. Dr. Hobotov had Andrey
Yefimitch&rsquo;s post; he was still living in his old lodgings, waiting
for Andrey Yefimitch to arrive and clear out of the hospital
apartments. The plain woman whom he called his cook was already
established in one of the lodges.</p>
<p>Fresh scandals about the hospital were going the round of the town.
It was said that the plain woman had quarrelled with the superintendent,
and that the latter had crawled on his knees before her begging
forgiveness. On the very first day he arrived Andrey Yefimitch had
to look out for lodgings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; the postmaster said to him timidly, &ldquo;excuse an indiscreet
question: what means have you at your disposal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch, without a word, counted out his money and said:
&ldquo;Eighty-six roubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; Mihail Averyanitch brought out in confusion,
misunderstanding him; &ldquo;I mean, what have you to live on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, eighty-six roubles . . . I have nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mihail Averyanitch looked upon the doctor as an honourable man, yet
he suspected that he had accumulated a fortune of at least twenty
thousand. Now learning that Andrey Yefimitch was a beggar, that he
had nothing to live on he was for some reason suddenly moved to
tears and embraced his friend.</p>
<h2>XV</h2>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch now lodged in a little house with three windows.
There were only three rooms besides the kitchen in the little house.
The doctor lived in two of them which looked into the street, while
Daryushka and the landlady with her three children lived in the
third room and the kitchen. Sometimes the landlady&rsquo;s lover, a drunken
peasant who was rowdy and reduced the children and Daryushka to
terror, would come for the night. When he arrived and established
himself in the kitchen and demanded vodka, they all felt very
uncomfortable, and the doctor would be moved by pity to take the
crying children into his room and let them lie on his floor, and
this gave him great satisfaction.</p>
<p>He got up as before at eight o&rsquo;clock, and after his morning tea sat
down to read his old books and magazines: he had no money for new
ones. Either because the books were old, or perhaps because of the
change in his surroundings, reading exhausted him, and did not grip
his attention as before. That he might not spend his time in idleness
he made a detailed catalogue of his books and gummed little labels
on their backs, and this mechanical, tedious work seemed to him
more interesting than reading. The monotonous, tedious work lulled
his thoughts to sleep in some unaccountable way, and the time passed
quickly while he thought of nothing. Even sitting in the kitchen,
peeling potatoes with Daryushka or picking over the buckwheat grain,
seemed to him interesting. On Saturdays and Sundays he went to
church. Standing near the wall and half closing his eyes, he listened
to the singing and thought of his father, of his mother, of the
university, of the religions of the world; he felt calm and melancholy,
and as he went out of the church afterwards he regretted that the
service was so soon over. He went twice to the hospital to talk to
Ivan Dmitritch. But on both occasions Ivan Dmitritch was unusually
excited and ill-humoured; he bade the doctor leave him in peace,
as he had long been sick of empty chatter, and declared, to make
up for all his sufferings, he asked from the damned scoundrels only
one favour&ndash;solitary confinement. Surely they would not refuse
him even that? On both occasions when Andrey Yefimitch was taking
leave of him and wishing him good-night, he answered rudely and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Andrey Yefimitch did not know now whether to go to him for the
third time or not. He longed to go.</p>
<p>In old days Andrey Yefimitch used to walk about his rooms and think
in the interval after dinner, but now from dinner-time till evening
tea he lay on the sofa with his face to the back and gave himself
up to trivial thoughts which he could not struggle against. He was
mortified that after more than twenty years of service he had been
given neither a pension nor any assistance. It is true that he had
not done his work honestly, but, then, all who are in the Service
get a pension without distinction whether they are honest or not.
Contemporary justice lies precisely in the bestowal of grades,
orders, and pensions, not for moral qualities or capacities, but
for service whatever it may have been like. Why was he alone to be
an exception? He had no money at all. He was ashamed to pass by the
shop and look at the woman who owned it. He owed thirty-two roubles
for beer already. There was money owing to the landlady also.
Daryushka sold old clothes and books on the sly, and told lies to
the landlady, saying that the doctor was just going to receive a
large sum of money.</p>
<p>He was angry with himself for having wasted on travelling the
thousand roubles he had saved up. How useful that thousand roubles
would have been now! He was vexed that people would not leave him
in peace. Hobotov thought it his duty to look in on his sick colleague
from time to time. Everything about him was revolting to Andrey
Yefimitch&ndash;his well-fed face and vulgar, condescending tone, and
his use of the word &ldquo;colleague,&rdquo; and his high top-boots; the most
revolting thing was that he thought it was his duty to treat Andrey
Yefimitch, and thought that he really was treating him. On every
visit he brought a bottle of bromide and rhubarb pills.</p>
<p>Mihail Averyanitch, too, thought it his duty to visit his friend
and entertain him. Every time he went in to Andrey Yefimitch with
an affectation of ease, laughed constrainedly, and began assuring
him that he was looking very well to-day, and that, thank God, he
was on the highroad to recovery, and from this it might be concluded
that he looked on his friend&rsquo;s condition as hopeless. He had not
yet repaid his Warsaw debt, and was overwhelmed by shame; he was
constrained, and so tried to laugh louder and talk more amusingly.
His anecdotes and descriptions seemed endless now, and were an agony
both to Andrey Yefimitch and himself.</p>
<p>In his presence Andrey Yefimitch usually lay on the sofa with his
face to the wall, and listened with his teeth clenched; his soul
was oppressed with rankling disgust, and after every visit from his
friend he felt as though this disgust had risen higher, and was
mounting into his throat.</p>
<p>To stifle petty thoughts he made haste to reflect that he himself,
and Hobotov, and Mihail Averyanitch, would all sooner or later
perish without leaving any trace on the world. If one imagined some
spirit flying by the earthly globe in space in a million years he
would see nothing but clay and bare rocks. Everything&ndash;culture
and the moral law&ndash;would pass away and not even a burdock would
grow out of them. Of what consequence was shame in the presence of
a shopkeeper, of what consequence was the insignificant Hobotov or
the wearisome friendship of Mihail Averyanitch? It was all trivial
and nonsensical.</p>
<p>But such reflections did not help him now. Scarcely had he imagined
the earthly globe in a million years, when Hobotov in his high
top-boots or Mihail Averyanitch with his forced laugh would appear
from behind a bare rock, and he even heard the shamefaced whisper:
&ldquo;The Warsaw debt. . . . I will repay it in a day or two, my dear
fellow, without fail. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<h2>XVI</h2>
<p>One day Mihail Averyanitch came after dinner when Andrey Yefimitch
was lying on the sofa. It so happened that Hobotov arrived at the
same time with his bromide. Andrey Yefimitch got up heavily and sat
down, leaning both arms on the sofa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a much better colour to-day than you had yesterday, my
dear man,&rdquo; began Mihail Averyanitch. &ldquo;Yes, you look jolly. Upon my
soul, you do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s high time you were well, dear colleague,&rdquo; said Hobotov,
yawning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be bound, you are sick of this bobbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we shall recover,&rdquo; said Mihail Averyanitch cheerfully. &ldquo;We
shall live another hundred years! To be sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a hundred years, but another twenty,&rdquo; Hobotov said reassuringly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, all right, colleague; don&rsquo;t lose heart. . . . Don&rsquo;t
go piling it on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll show what we can do,&rdquo; laughed Mihail Averyanitch, and he
slapped his friend on the knee. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll show them yet! Next summer,
please God, we shall be off to the Caucasus, and we will ride all
over it on horseback&ndash;trot, trot, trot! And when we are back from
the Caucasus I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if we will all dance at the wedding.&rdquo;
Mihail Averyanitch gave a sly wink. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll marry you, my dear boy,
we&rsquo;ll marry you. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch felt suddenly that the rising disgust had mounted
to his throat, his heart began beating violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s vulgar,&rdquo; he said, getting up quickly and walking away to
the window. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand that you are talking vulgar
nonsense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He meant to go on softly and politely, but against his will he
suddenly clenched his fists and raised them above his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me alone,&rdquo; he shouted in a voice unlike his own, blushing
crimson and shaking all over. &ldquo;Go away, both of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mihail Averyanitch and Hobotov got up and stared at him first with
amazement and then with alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away, both!&rdquo; Andrey Yefimitch went on shouting. &ldquo;Stupid people!
Foolish people! I don&rsquo;t want either your friendship or your medicines,
stupid man! Vulgar! Nasty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hobotov and Mihail Averyanitch, looking at each other in bewilderment,
staggered to the door and went out. Andrey Yefimitch snatched up
the bottle of bromide and flung it after them; the bottle broke
with a crash on the door-frame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to the devil!&rdquo; he shouted in a tearful voice, running out into
the passage. &ldquo;To the devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When his guests were gone Andrey Yefimitch lay down on the sofa,
trembling as though in a fever, and went on for a long while
repeating: &ldquo;Stupid people! Foolish people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was calmer, what occurred to him first of all was the thought
that poor Mihail Averyanitch must be feeling fearfully ashamed and
depressed now, and that it was all dreadful. Nothing like this had
ever happened to him before. Where was his intelligence and his
tact? Where was his comprehension of things and his philosophical
indifference?</p>
<p>The doctor could not sleep all night for shame and vexation with
himself, and at ten o&rsquo;clock next morning he went to the post office
and apologized to the postmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t think again of what has happened,&rdquo; Mihail Averyanitch,
greatly touched, said with a sigh, warmly pressing his hand. &ldquo;Let
bygones be bygones. Lyubavkin,&rdquo; he suddenly shouted so loud that
all the postmen and other persons present started, &ldquo;hand a chair;
and you wait,&rdquo; he shouted to a peasant woman who was stretching out
a registered letter to him through the grating. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that
I am busy? We will not remember the past,&rdquo; he went on, affectionately
addressing Andrey Yefimitch; &ldquo;sit down, I beg you, my dear fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a minute he stroked his knees in silence, and then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never had a thought of taking offence. Illness is no joke,
I understand. Your attack frightened the doctor and me yesterday,
and we had a long talk about you afterwards. My dear friend, why
won&rsquo;t you treat your illness seriously? You can&rsquo;t go on like this
. . . . Excuse me speaking openly as a friend,&rdquo; whispered Mihail
Averyanitch. &ldquo;You live in the most unfavourable surroundings, in a
crowd, in uncleanliness, no one to look after you, no money for
proper treatment. . . . My dear friend, the doctor and I implore
you with all our hearts, listen to our advice: go into the hospital!
There you will have wholesome food and attendance and treatment.
Though, between ourselves, Yevgeny Fyodoritch is <em>mauvais ton</em>, yet
he does understand his work, you can fully rely upon him. He has
promised me he will look after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch was touched by the postmaster&rsquo;s genuine sympathy
and the tears which suddenly glittered on his cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My honoured friend, don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; he whispered, laying his
hand on his heart; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t believe them. It&rsquo;s all a sham. My illness
is only that in twenty years I have only found one intelligent man
in the whole town, and he is mad. I am not ill at all, it&rsquo;s simply
that I have got into an enchanted circle which there is no getting
out of. I don&rsquo;t care; I am ready for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go into the hospital, my dear fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if it were into the pit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your word, my dear man, that you will obey Yevgeny Fyodoritch
in everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I will give you my word. But I repeat, my honoured friend,
I have got into an enchanted circle. Now everything, even the genuine
sympathy of my friends, leads to the same thing&ndash;to my ruin. I
am going to my ruin, and I have the manliness to recognize it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, you will recover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of saying that?&rdquo; said Andrey Yefimitch, with
irritation. &ldquo;There are few men who at the end of their lives do not
experience what I am experiencing now. When you are told that you
have something such as diseased kidneys or enlarged heart, and you
begin being treated for it, or are told you are mad or a
criminal&ndash;that is, in fact, when people suddenly turn their attention to
you&ndash;you may be sure you have got into an enchanted circle from
which you will not escape. You will try to escape and make things
worse. You had better give in, for no human efforts can save you.
So it seems to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the public was crowding at the grating. That he might not
be in their way, Andrey Yefimitch got up and began to take leave.
Mihail Averyanitch made him promise on his honour once more, and
escorted him to the outer door.</p>
<p>Towards evening on the same day Hobotov, in his sheepskin and his
high top-boots, suddenly made his appearance, and said to Andrey
Yefimitch in a tone as though nothing had happened the day before:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come on business, colleague. I have come to ask you whether
you would not join me in a consultation. Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thinking that Hobotov wanted to distract his mind with an outing,
or perhaps really to enable him to earn something, Andrey Yefimitch
put on his coat and hat, and went out with him into the street. He
was glad of the opportunity to smooth over his fault of the previous
day and to be reconciled, and in his heart thanked Hobotov, who did
not even allude to yesterday&rsquo;s scene and was evidently sparing him.
One would never have expected such delicacy from this uncultured
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your invalid?&rdquo; asked Andrey Yefimitch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the hospital. . . . I have long wanted to show him to you. A
very interesting case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went into the hospital yard, and going round the main building,
turned towards the lodge where the mental cases were kept, and all
this, for some reason, in silence. When they went into the lodge
Nikita as usual jumped up and stood at attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the patients here has a lung complication.&rdquo; Hobotov said
in an undertone, going into the yard with Andrey Yefimitch. &ldquo;You
wait here, I&rsquo;ll be back directly. I am going for a stethoscope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he went away.</p>
<h2>XVII</h2>
<p>It was getting dusk. Ivan Dmitritch was lying on his bed with his
face thrust unto his pillow; the paralytic was sitting motionless,
crying quietly and moving his lips. The fat peasant and the former
sorter were asleep. It was quiet.</p>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch sat down on Ivan Dmitritch&rsquo;s bed and waited. But
half an hour passed, and instead of Hobotov, Nikita came into the
ward with a dressing-gown, some underlinen, and a pair of slippers
in a heap on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please change your things, your honour,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;Here is
your bed; come this way,&rdquo; he added, pointing to an empty bedstead
which had obviously recently been brought into the ward. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all
right; please God, you will recover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch understood it all. Without saying a word he crossed
to the bed to which Nikita pointed and sat down; seeing that Nikita
was standing waiting, he undressed entirely and he felt ashamed.
Then he put on the hospital clothes; the drawers were very short,
the shirt was long, and the dressing-gown smelt of smoked fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please God, you will recover,&rdquo; repeated Nikita, and he gathered
up Andrey Yefimitch&rsquo;s clothes into his arms, went out, and shut the
door after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter . . .&rdquo; thought Andrey Yefimitch, wrapping himself in his
dressing-gown in a shamefaced way and feeling that he looked like
a convict in his new costume. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no matter. . . . It does not
matter whether it&rsquo;s a dress-coat or a uniform or this dressing-gown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But how about his watch? And the notebook that was in the side-pocket?
And his cigarettes? Where had Nikita taken his clothes? Now perhaps
to the day of his death he would not put on trousers, a waistcoat,
and high boots. It was all somehow strange and even incomprehensible
at first. Andrey Yefimitch was even now convinced that there was
no difference between his landlady&rsquo;s house and Ward No. 6, that
everything in this world was nonsense and vanity of vanities. And
yet his hands were trembling, his feet were cold, and he was filled
with dread at the thought that soon Ivan Dmitritch would get up and
see that he was in a dressing-gown. He got up and walked across the
room and sat down again.</p>
<p>Here he had been sitting already half an hour, an hour, and he was
miserably sick of it: was it really possible to live here a day, a
week, and even years like these people? Why, he had been sitting
here, had walked about and sat down again; he could get up and look
out of window and walk from corner to corner again, and then what?
Sit so all the time, like a post, and think? No, that was scarcely
possible.</p>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch lay down, but at once got up, wiped the cold sweat
from his brow with his sleeve and felt that his whole face smelt
of smoked fish. He walked about again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s some misunderstanding . . .&rdquo; he said, turning out the palms
of his hands in perplexity. &ldquo;It must be cleared up. There is a
misunderstanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Ivan Dmitritch woke up; he sat up and propped his cheeks
on his fists. He spat. Then he glanced lazily at the doctor, and
apparently for the first minute did not understand; but soon his
sleepy face grew malicious and mocking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha! so they have put you in here, too, old fellow?&rdquo; he said in a
voice husky from sleepiness, screwing up one eye. &ldquo;Very glad to see
you. You sucked the blood of others, and now they will suck yours.
Excellent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a misunderstanding . . .&rdquo; Andrey Yefimitch brought out,
frightened by Ivan Dmitritch&rsquo;s words; he shrugged his shoulders and
repeated: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s some misunderstanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ivan Dmitritch spat again and lay down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cursed life,&rdquo; he grumbled, &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s bitter and insulting, this
life will not end in compensation for our sufferings, it will not
end with apotheosis as it would in an opera, but with death; peasants
will come and drag one&rsquo;s dead body by the arms and the legs to the
cellar. Ugh! Well, it does not matter. . . . We shall have our good
time in the other world. . . . I shall come here as a ghost from
the other world and frighten these reptiles. I&rsquo;ll turn their hair
grey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moiseika returned, and, seeing the doctor, held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me one little kopeck,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<h2>XVIII</h2>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch walked away to the window and looked out into the
open country. It was getting dark, and on the horizon to the right
a cold crimson moon was mounting upwards. Not far from the hospital
fence, not much more than two hundred yards away, stood a tall white
house shut in by a stone wall. This was the prison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this is real life,&rdquo; thought Andrey Yefimitch, and he felt
frightened.</p>
<p>The moon and the prison, and the nails on the fence, and the far-away
flames at the bone-charring factory were all terrible. Behind him
there was the sound of a sigh. Andrey Yefimitch looked round and
saw a man with glittering stars and orders on his breast, who was
smiling and slyly winking. And this, too, seemed terrible.</p>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch assured himself that there was nothing special
about the moon or the prison, that even sane persons wear orders,
and that everything in time will decay and turn to earth, but he
was suddenly overcome with desire; he clutched at the grating with
both hands and shook it with all his might. The strong grating did
not yield.</p>
<p>Then that it might not be so dreadful he went to Ivan Dmitritch&rsquo;s
bed and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have lost heart, my dear fellow,&rdquo; he muttered, trembling and
wiping away the cold sweat, &ldquo;I have lost heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should be philosophical,&rdquo; said Ivan Dmitritch ironically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, my God. . . . Yes, yes. . . . You were pleased to say once
that there was no philosophy in Russia, but that all people, even
the paltriest, talk philosophy. But you know the philosophizing of
the paltriest does not harm anyone,&rdquo; said Andrey Yefimitch in a
tone as if he wanted to cry and complain. &ldquo;Why, then, that malignant
laugh, my friend, and how can these paltry creatures help philosophizing
if they are not satisfied? For an intelligent, educated man, made
in God&rsquo;s image, proud and loving freedom, to have no alternative
but to be a doctor in a filthy, stupid, wretched little town, and
to spend his whole life among bottles, leeches, mustard plasters!
Quackery, narrowness, vulgarity! Oh, my God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are talking nonsense. If you don&rsquo;t like being a doctor you
should have gone in for being a statesman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not, I could not do anything. We are weak, my dear friend
. . . . I used to be indifferent. I reasoned boldly and soundly, but
at the first coarse touch of life upon me I have lost heart. . . .
Prostration. . . . . We are weak, we are poor creatures . . . and
you, too, my dear friend, you are intelligent, generous, you drew
in good impulses with your mother&rsquo;s milk, but you had hardly entered
upon life when you were exhausted and fell ill. . . . Weak, weak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch was all the while at the approach of evening
tormented by another persistent sensation besides terror and the
feeling of resentment. At last he realized that he was longing for
a smoke and for beer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going out, my friend,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will tell them to bring a
light; I can&rsquo;t put up with this. . . . I am not equal to it. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrey Yefimitch went to the door and opened it, but at once Nikita
jumped up and barred his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going? You can&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bedtime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m only going out for a minute to walk about the yard,&rdquo; said
Andrey Yefimitch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t; it&rsquo;s forbidden. You know that yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what difference will it make to anyone if I do go out?&rdquo; asked
Andrey Yefimitch, shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.
Nikita, I must go out!&rdquo; he said in a trembling voice. &ldquo;I must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be disorderly, it&rsquo;s not right,&rdquo; Nikita said peremptorily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is beyond everything,&rdquo; Ivan Dmitritch cried suddenly, and he
jumped up. &ldquo;What right has he not to let you out? How dare they
keep us here? I believe it is clearly laid down in the law that no
one can be deprived of freedom without trial! It&rsquo;s an outrage! It&rsquo;s
tyranny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s tyranny,&rdquo; said Andrey Yefimitch, encouraged by Ivan
Dmitritch&rsquo;s outburst. &ldquo;I must go out, I want to. He has no right!
Open, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear, you dull-witted brute?&rdquo; cried Ivan Dmitritch, and he
banged on the door with his fist. &ldquo;Open the door, or I will break
it open! Torturer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the door,&rdquo; cried Andrey Yefimitch, trembling all over; &ldquo;I
insist!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk away!&rdquo; Nikita answered through the door, &ldquo;talk away. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, go and call Yevgeny Fyodoritch! Say that I beg him to come
for a minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His honour will come of himself to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will never let us out,&rdquo; Ivan Dmitritch was going on meanwhile.
&ldquo;They will leave us to rot here! Oh, Lord, can there really be no
hell in the next world, and will these wretches be forgiven? Where
is justice? Open the door, you wretch! I am choking!&rdquo; he cried in
a hoarse voice, and flung himself upon the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll dash out my
brains, murderers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nikita opened the door quickly, and roughly with both his hands and
his knee shoved Andrey Yefimitch back, then swung his arm and punched
him in the face with his fist. It seemed to Andrey Yefimitch as
though a huge salt wave enveloped him from his head downwards and
dragged him to the bed; there really was a salt taste in his mouth:
most likely the blood was running from his teeth. He waved his arms
as though he were trying to swim out and clutched at a bedstead,
and at the same moment felt Nikita hit him twice on the back.</p>
<p>Ivan Dmitritch gave a loud scream. He must have been beaten too.</p>
<p>Then all was still, the faint moonlight came through the grating,
and a shadow like a net lay on the floor. It was terrible. Andrey
Yefimitch lay and held his breath: he was expecting with horror to
be struck again. He felt as though someone had taken a sickle,
thrust it into him, and turned it round several times in his breast
and bowels. He bit the pillow from pain and clenched his teeth, and
all at once through the chaos in his brain there flashed the terrible
unbearable thought that these people, who seemed now like black
shadows in the moonlight, had to endure such pain day by day for
years. How could it have happened that for more than twenty years
he had not known it and had refused to know it? He knew nothing of
pain, had no conception of it, so he was not to blame, but his
conscience, as inexorable and as rough as Nikita, made him turn
cold from the crown of his head to his heels. He leaped up, tried
to cry out with all his might, and to run in haste to kill Nikita,
and then Hobotov, the superintendent and the assistant, and then
himself; but no sound came from his chest, and his legs would not
obey him. Gasping for breath, he tore at the dressing-gown and the
shirt on his breast, rent them, and fell senseless on the bed.</p>
<h2>XIX</h2>
<p>Next morning his head ached, there was a droning in his ears and a
feeling of utter weakness all over. He was not ashamed at recalling
his weakness the day before. He had been cowardly, had even been
afraid of the moon, had openly expressed thoughts and feelings such
as he had not expected in himself before; for instance, the thought
that the paltry people who philosophized were really dissatisfied.
But now nothing mattered to him.</p>
<p>He ate nothing; he drank nothing. He lay motionless and silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all the same to me,&rdquo; he thought when they asked him questions.
&ldquo;I am not going to answer. . . . It&rsquo;s all the same to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After dinner Mihail Averyanitch brought him a quarter pound of tea
and a pound of fruit pastilles. Daryushka came too and stood for a
whole hour by the bed with an expression of dull grief on her face.
Dr. Hobotov visited him. He brought a bottle of bromide and told
Nikita to fumigate the ward with something.</p>
<p>Towards evening Andrey Yefimitch died of an apoplectic stroke. At
first he had a violent shivering fit and a feeling of sickness;
something revolting as it seemed, penetrating through his whole
body, even to his finger-tips, strained from his stomach to his
head and flooded his eyes and ears. There was a greenness before
his eyes. Andrey Yefimitch understood that his end had come, and
remembered that Ivan Dmitritch, Mihail Averyanitch, and millions
of people believed in immortality. And what if it really existed?
But he did not want immortality&ndash;and he thought of it only for
one instant. A herd of deer, extraordinarily beautiful and graceful,
of which he had been reading the day before, ran by him; then a
peasant woman stretched out her hand to him with a registered letter
. . . . Mihail Averyanitch said something, then it all vanished, and
Andrey Yefimitch sank into oblivion for ever.</p>
<p>The hospital porters came, took him by his arms and legs, and carried
him away to the chapel.</p>
<p>There he lay on the table, with open eyes, and the moon shed its
light upon him at night. In the morning Sergey Sergeyitch came,
prayed piously before the crucifix, and closed his former chief&rsquo;s
eyes.</p>
<p>Next day Andrey Yefimitch was buried. Mihail Averyanitch and Daryushka
were the only people at the funeral.</p>

<p>Al pati de l&rsquo;hospital s&rsquo;alça un petit pavelló envoltat d&rsquo;una autèntica selva de bardanes, ortigues i cànem silvestre. La teulada està rovellada, la xemeneia s&rsquo;ensorra, els graons de l&rsquo;entrada es marceixen i s&rsquo;han cobert d&rsquo;herba, i de l&rsquo;estucat només en queden les traces. La façana del pavelló mira cap a l&rsquo;hospital; per darrere dona al camp obert, del qual el separa la tanca grisa de l&rsquo;hospital coronada amb claus. Aquests claus, amb la punta cap amunt, i la tanca, i el mateix pavelló, tenen aquell aspecte peculiar, desolat, oblidat de Déu, que només es troba als nostres edificis hospitalaris i penitenciaris.</p>
<p>Si no teniu por que us piquin les ortigues, seguiu el sender estret que porta al pavelló, i vegem què passa a dins. Obrint la primera porta, entrem al vestíbul. Aquí, per les parets i vora l&rsquo;estufa, s&rsquo;amuntega tota mena de deixalles hospitalàries. Matalassos, bates velles i esquinçades, pantalons, camises de ratlles blaves, botes i sabates que ja no serveixen per a res&hellip; tots aquests despulls s&rsquo;apilen en munts, barrejats i arrugats, marcint-se i desprenent una pudor punyent.</p>
<p>El porter, Nikita, un vell soldat que llueix els galons rovellats per bon comportament, sempre jeu a la pallissa amb la pipa entre les dents. Té la cara sombria, malhumorada, amb aire de rosegat, unes celles prominents que li donen expressió de gos pastor de les estepes, i el nas vermell; és baix i té aspecte sec i desgavellat, però el seu port és imponent i té els punys vigorosos. Pertany a la classe de gent de cor simple, pràctica i d&rsquo;enteniment lent, que executa ràpidament les ordres, que estima la disciplina per sobre de tot al món, i per això està convençut que és el seu deure pegar la gent. Reparteix cops a la cara, al pit, a l&rsquo;esquena, allà on li ve de gust, i està convençut que no hi hauria ordre al lloc si ell no ho fes.</p>
<p>Després arribes a una habitació gran i espaiosa que ocupa tot el pavelló excepte l&rsquo;entrada. Aquí les parets estan pintades d&rsquo;un blau brut, el sostre és tan negre de sutge com el d&rsquo;una cabana sense xemeneia —és evident que a l&rsquo;hivern l&rsquo;estufa fa fum i l&rsquo;habitació s&rsquo;omple de vapors. Les finestres estan desfigurades per reixes de ferro a l&rsquo;interior. El terra de fusta és gris i ple d&rsquo;estelles. Hi ha una pudor de col agra, de metxes cremant-se, de xinxons i d&rsquo;amoníac, i durant el primer minut aquesta pudor et dóna la impressió d&rsquo;haver entrat en una menageria.</p>
<p>Hi ha llits de ferro cargolats al terra. Homes amb bates d&rsquo;hospital blaves i amb gorretes de dormir a l&rsquo;antiga usança hi estan asseguts i estirats. Aquests són els malalts mentals.</p>
<p>En total n&rsquo;hi ha cinc. Només un és de la classe alta, la resta són tots artesans. El més proper a la porta —un treballador alt i prim amb bigotis vermells lluents i ulls plens de llàgrimes— seu amb el cap recolzat a la mà, mirant fixament el mateix punt. Dia i nit es lamenta, sacsejant el cap, sospirant i somrient amargament. No participa en les converses i generalment no respon a les preguntes; menja i beu mecànicament quan li ofereixen menjar. Per la seva tos angoixant i palpitant, la seva prima i el vermellor de les galtes, hom pot jutjar que està en la primera fase de la tuberculosi. Al seu costat hi ha un home petit, àgil i molt vivaç, amb una barba en punta i cabells negres i arrissats com els d&rsquo;un negre. Durant el dia camina amunt i avall per la sala de finestra en finestra, o seu al llit amb les cames creuades com un turc, i, incansable com un cadernera que xiula, canta suaument i rialleja. Mostra la seva alegria infantil i el seu caràcter vivaç també de nit quan es lleva per resar —és a dir, per colpejar-se el pit amb els punys i gratar amb els dits a la porta. Aquest és el jueu Moisseika, un imbècil que es va tornar boig fa vint anys quan se li va cremar la fàbrica de barrets.</p>
<p>I de tots els habitants de la Sala número 6, és l&rsquo;únic a qui permeten sortir del pavelló, i fins i tot del pati al carrer. Fa anys que gaudeix d&rsquo;aquest privilegi, probablement perquè és un habitant veterà de l&rsquo;hospital: un imbècil inofensiu i tranquil, el bufó del poble, on la gent està acostumada a veure&rsquo;l envoltat de nois i gossos. Amb la seva bata miserable, el seu barret de nit absurd i sabatilles, de vegades amb les cames nues i fins i tot sense pantalons, passeja pels carrers, s&rsquo;atura a les portes i les botigues petites, i demana almoina. En un lloc li donen kvass, en un altre pa, en un altre una moneda, de manera que generalment torna a la sala sentint-se ric i ben alimentat. Tot el que porta Nikita li ho pren per al seu propi benefici. El soldat ho fa amb brutalitat, amb ira li gira les butxaques cap per avall, i jura per Déu que no el deixarà sortir al carrer mai més, i que saltar-se les normes és el pitjor que li pot passar.</p>

<p>M&rsquo;agrada la seva cara ampla amb els pòmuls alts, sempre pàl·lida i trista, que reflecteix, com en un mirall, una ànima turmentada pel conflicte i un terror de llarga durada. Les seves ganyotes són estranyes i anormals, però les línies delicades que el patiment profund i genuí ha gravat en el seu rostre mostren intel·ligència i seny, i als seus ulls hi ha una llum càlida i sana. M&rsquo;agrada l&rsquo;home en si mateix, cortès, amb ganes d&rsquo;ajudar i extraordinàriament amable amb tothom excepte amb Nikita. Quan algú deixa caure un botó o una cullera, es dreça ràpidament del llit i el recull; cada dia dona els bons dies als seus companys, i quan se&rsquo;n va a dormir els desitja bona nit.</p>
<p>A més del seu estat d&rsquo;agitació permanent i de les seves ganyotes, la seva bogeria també es manifesta de la manera següent. De vegades, al vespre, s&rsquo;embolicalla en la seva bata i, tremolant de dalt a baix i castanyetejant les dents, comença a caminar ràpidament d&rsquo;un racó a l&rsquo;altre i pels lliteres. Sembla que tingui una febre violenta. Pel fet que s&rsquo;atura de cop i mira els seus companys, es pot veure que té un gran desig de dir alguna cosa molt important, però, aparentment reflexionant que no l&rsquo;escoltarien o no l&rsquo;entendrien, sacseja el cap amb impaciència i continua fent el vai-i-ve. Però aviat el desig de parlar s&rsquo;imposa a qualsevol consideració, i es llança a parlar amb fervor i passió. La seva xerrada és desordenada i febril com el deliri, inconexa i no sempre intel·ligible, però, d&rsquo;altra banda, s&rsquo;hi pot percebre quelcom extremadament fi, tant en les paraules com en la veu. Quan parla, s&rsquo;hi reconeix el boig i l&rsquo;home. És difícil reproduir en paper la seva xerrada dement. Parla de la baixesa de la humanitat, de la violència que trepitja la justícia, de la vida gloriosa que algun dia hi haurà a la terra, de les reixes de les finestres que li recorden constantment l&rsquo;estupidesa i la crueltat dels opressors.</p>
<h2>II</h2>
<p>Fa uns dotze o quinze anys, un funcionari anomenat Gromov, persona molt respectable i acomodada, vivia a casa seva al carrer principal de la ciutat. Tenia dos fills, Serguei i Ivan. Quan Serguei cursava el quart any d&rsquo;estudiant va caure malalt de tuberculosi fulminant i va morir, i la seva mort va ser, per dir-ho així, la primera d&rsquo;una sèrie sencera de calamitats que de sobte es van abatre sobre la família Gromov. A la setmana del funeral de Serguei, el pare ancià va ser processat per frau i malversació, i va morir poc després de tifus a l&rsquo;hospital de la presó. La casa, amb totes les seves pertinences, va ser venuda en subhasta, i Ivan Dmitrítx i la seva mare van quedar completament sense recursos.</p>
<p>Fins aleshores, en vida del seu pare, Ivan Dmitrítx, que estudiava a la Universitat de Sant Petersburg, rebia una assignació de seixanta o setanta rubles al mes i no tenia cap noció de la pobresa; ara havia de fer un canvi abrupte en la seva vida. Havia de passar el temps del matí a la nit donant lliçons a canvi de gairebé res, treballar copiant manuscrits, i malgrat tot això passar gana, ja que tots els seus guanys els enviava a la mare per mantenir-la. Ivan Dmitrítx no va poder suportar aquesta vida; va perdre l&rsquo;ànim i les forces i, abandonant la universitat, va tornar a casa.</p>
<p>Aquí, per influència, va obtenir el càrrec de mestre a l&rsquo;escola del districte, però no va poder entendre&rsquo;s amb els seus col·legues, no va ser del gust dels nois, i aviat va abandonar el lloc. La mare se li va morir. Va estar sis mesos sense feina, vivint només de pa i aigua; després va fer-se ujier de tribunal. Va conservar aquest lloc fins que va ser acomiadat a causa de la seva malaltia.</p>
<p>Ni tan sols en els seus joves anys d&rsquo;estudiant havia donat mai la impressió de gaudir de perfecta salut. Sempre havia estat pàl·lid, prim i enclinat a refredar-se; menjava poc i dormia malament. Un sol got de vi se li enfilava al cap i el posava histèric. Sempre havia tingut ànsia de societat, però, a causa del seu temperament irritable i suspicaç, mai no va arribar a intimar gaire amb ningú, i no tenia amics. Sempre parlava amb menyspreu dels seus conciutadans, dient que la seva ignorància grollera i la seva existència animal i endormiscada li semblaven repugnants i horribles. Parlava amb veu de tenor sonora, amb vehemència, i invariablement o bé amb menyspreu i indignació, o bé amb meravella i entusiasme, i sempre amb perfecta sinceritat. De qualsevol cosa que hom li parlés, sempre ho reconduïa al mateix tema: que la vida era avorrida i ofegant a la ciutat; que la gent del poble no tenia interessos elevats, sinó que vivia una vida bruta i sense sentit, diversificada per la violència, la grolleria libertina i la hipocresia; que els bergants estaven ben alimentats i ben vestits, mentre els homes honrats vivien de la mà a la boca; que calia escoles, un diari local progressista, un teatre, conferències públiques, la coordinació dels elements intel·lectuals; que la societat havia de veure els seus defectes i horroritzar-se. En les seves crítiques de la gent hi posava colors espessos, servint-se només del negre i del blanc, sense matisos subtils; la humanitat es dividia per a ell entre homes honrats i bergants: no hi havia res entremig. Sempre parlava amb passió i entusiasme de les dones i de l&rsquo;amor, però mai no havia estat enamorat.</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<p>Un matí de tardor Ivan Dmitritx, alçant-se el coll de la capa i xotant pel fang, va fer via pels carrerons per anar a veure un artesà i cobrar un deute. Estava de mal humor, com sempre al matí. En un dels carrerons es va trobar amb dos presoners encadenats i quatre soldats amb fusells que els vigilaven. Ivan Dmitritx havia vist moltes vegades presoners abans, i sempre li havien despertat sentiments de compassió i malestar; però ara aquesta trobada li va fer una impressió peculiar, estranya. De sobte se li va acudir que ell també podria ser posat en cadenes i conduït pel fang fins a la presó. Després de visitar l&rsquo;artesà, de camí cap a casa es va trobar prop de l&rsquo;oficina de correus amb un comissari de policia que coneixia, el qual el va saludar i va caminar uns quants passos amb ell pel carrer, i per alguna raó això li va semblar sospitós. A casa no se li van poder treure del cap en tot el dia ni els presoners ni els soldats amb els fusells, i una agitació interior inexplicable li va impedir llegir o concentrar-se. Al vespre no va encendre el llum, i a la nit no va poder dormir, sinó que va estar pensant que el podrien detenir, posar-li cadenes i tirar-lo a la presó. No sabia de cap mal que hagués fet, i podia estar segur que mai no seria culpable de cap assassinat, incendi o robatori en el futur; però no era fàcil cometre un delicte per accident, inconscientment? I el fals testimoni no era sempre possible? I, en efecte, un error judicial? No sense raó l&rsquo;experiència secular de la gent senzilla ensenya que la misèria i la presó són mals dels quals ningú no està a salv. Un error judicial és molt possible tal com es condueixen avui dia els procediments legals, i no hi ha res d&rsquo;estrany en això. La gent que té una relació oficial, professional, amb els sofriments d&rsquo;altres homes —per exemple, jutges, policies, metges— amb el temps, per costum, es tornen tan insensibles que no poden, encara que ho vulguin, tenir una altra actitud que no sigui formal amb els seus clients; en aquest aspecte no es diferencien del pagès que mata ovelles i vedells al pati i no s&rsquo;adona de la sang. Amb aquesta actitud formal, sense ànima, cap a la personalitat humana, el jutge només necessita una cosa —temps— per privar un innocent de tots els drets de propietat i condemnar-lo a treballs forçats. Només el temps emprat a realitzar certes formalitats per les quals el jutge cobra el seu sou, i després&hellip; tot s&rsquo;ha acabat. Llavors pots buscar en va justícia i protecció en aquesta ciutat bruta i miserable a cent cinquanta milles d&rsquo;una estació de tren! I, de fet, no és absurd fins i tot pensar en justícia quan tota mena de violència és acceptada per la societat com una necessitat racional i coherent, i cada acte de misericòrdia —per exemple, un veredicte d&rsquo;absolució— provoca un perfecte esclat de sentiment insatisfet i venjatiu?</p>
<p>Al matí Ivan Dmitritx es va aixecar del llit en estat d&rsquo;horror, amb suor freda al front, completament convençut que podria ser detingut en qualsevol moment. Ja que els seus pensaments ombrívols d&rsquo;ahir l&rsquo;havien turmentat tant de temps, va pensar, havia de ser que hi havia alguna veritat en ells. No podien, de fet, haver-li vingut al cap sense cap fonament.</p>
<p>Un policia caminant lentament va passar per davant les finestres: això no era per res. Aquí hi havia dos homes drets i silenciosos prop de la casa. Per què callaven? I dies i nits agonitzants van seguir per a Ivan Dmitritx. Tots els qui passaven per davant les finestres o entraven al pati li semblaven un espia o un detectiu. Al migdia el cap de policia solia baixar pel carrer amb un parell de cavalls; anava des de la seva finca prop del poble fins al departament de policia; però Ivan Dmitritx s&rsquo;imaginava cada vegada que conduïa especialment de pressa, i que tenia una expressió peculiar: era evident que tenia pressa d&rsquo;anunciar que hi havia un criminal molt important al poble. Ivan Dmitritx es sobresaltava a cada toc de timbre i cop a la porta, i s&rsquo;agitava sempre que trobava algú nou a casa de la seva patrona; quan es trobava amb policies i gendarmes somreia i començava a xiular per semblar despreocupat. No podia dormir nits senceres esperant ser detingut, però roncava fort i sospirava com si dormís profundament, perquè la seva patrona pensés que dormia; perquè si no podia dormir volia dir que estava turmentat pels remordiments de consciència&hellip; quina prova! Els fets i el sentit comú el convencien que tots aquests terrors eren ximpleries i morbidesa, que si hom mirava la qüestió més àmpliament no hi havia res realment terrible en la detenció i l&rsquo;empresonament —mentre la consciència estigués tranquil·la; però com més sensatament i lògicament raonable, més aguda i agonitzant es tornava la seva angoxa mental. Es podria comparar amb la història d&rsquo;un ermità que va tractar de tallar-se un lloc d&rsquo;habitatge en un bosc verge; com més zelosament treballava amb la seva destral, més espès es tornava el bosc. Al final Ivan Dmitritx, veient que era inútil, va renunciar completament a raonar, i es va abandonar enterament a la desesperació i el terror.</p>
<p>Va començar a evitar la gent i buscar la soledat. La seva feina oficial ja li havia estat desagradable abans: ara es va tornar insuportable per a ell. Tenia por que d&rsquo;alguna manera el ficassin en problemes, que li posassin un suborn a la butxaca sense que se n&rsquo;adonés i després el denunciessin, o que accidentalment cometés un error en papers oficials que semblés fraudulent, o que perdés els diners d&rsquo;altres. És estrany que la seva imaginació mai en altres moments no havia estat tan àgil i inventiva com ara, quan cada dia pensava en milers de raons diferents per estar seriosament ansiós per la seva llibertat i honor; però, d&rsquo;altra banda, el seu interès pel món exterior, pels llibres en particular, es va esvair sensiblement, i la seva memòria va començar a fallar-li.</p>
<p>A la primavera, quan la neu es va fondre, van ser trobats al barranc prop del cementiri dos cadàvers mig descompostos: els cossos d&rsquo;una dona gran i un noi que portaven traces de mort violenta. No es parlava més que d&rsquo;aquests cossos i dels seus assassins desconeguts. Perquè la gent no pensés que ell havia estat culpable del crim, Ivan Dmitritx caminava pels carrers somrient, i quan es trobava amb coneguts es tornava pàl·lid, s&rsquo;enrojolava, i començava a declarar que no hi havia cap crim més gran que l&rsquo;assassinat dels febles i indefensos. Però aquesta duplicitat aviat el va esgotar, i després d&rsquo;alguna reflexió va decidir que en la seva posició el millor que podia fer era amagar-se al soterrani de la seva patrona. Va seure al soterrani tot el dia i després tota la nit, després un altre dia, va tenir un fred terrible, i esperant fins al capvespre, va robar secretament com un lladre de tornada a la seva habitació. Es va quedar dret al mig de l&rsquo;habitació fins a l&rsquo;albada, escoltant sense moure&rsquo;s. Molt d&rsquo;hora al matí, abans de la sortida del sol, alguns treballadors van entrar a la casa. Ivan Dmitritx sabia perfectament bé que havien vingut a reparar la cuina de la cuina, però el terror li deia que eren policies disfressats de treballadors. Va lliscar sigilosament fora del pis, i, vençut pel terror, va córrer pel carrer sense barret ni abric. Els gossos li corrien al darrere bordant, un pagès va cridar en algun lloc al seu darrere, el vent li xiulava a les orelles, i li semblava a Ivan Dmitritx que la força i la violència del món sencer estaven acumulades darrere seu i el perseguien.</p>
<p>Va ser aturat i portat a casa, i la seva patrona va enviar a buscar un metge. El doctor Andrei Iefímitx, del qual tindrem més coses a dir més endavant, va prescriure compreses fredes al cap i gotes de llorer, va sacsejar el cap, i se&rsquo;n va anar, dient a la patrona que no hauria de tornar, ja que hom no s&rsquo;hauria d&rsquo;entremetre amb gent que està perdent el seny. Com que no tenia mitjans per viure a casa i ser cuidat, Ivan Dmitritx va ser aviat enviat a l&rsquo;hospital, i allà va ser posat a la sala per a pacients venèrics. No podia dormir a la nit, estava ple de manies i fantasies, i molestava els pacients, i aviat després, per ordre d&rsquo;Andrei Iefímitx, va ser traslladat a la Sala número 6.</p>
<p>En un any Ivan Dmitritx va ser completament oblidat al poble, i els seus llibres, amuntegats per la seva patrona en un trineu al cobert, van ser fets trossos pels nois.</p>
<h2>IV</h2>
<p>El veí d&rsquo;Ivan Dmitrikh a l&rsquo;esquerra és, com ja he dit, el jueu Moiseika; el de la dreta és un pagès tan rodó de greix que és gairebé esfèric, amb una cara estúpida i buida, completament mancada de pensament. És un animal immòbil, golafre i brut que fa temps va perdre tota capacitat de pensar o sentir. Sempre en surt una pudor àcida i ofegosa.</p>
<p>Nikita, que l&rsquo;ha de netejar després, el zurra terriblement amb totes les seves forces, sense escatimar cops; i el que fa por no és que el peguin —a això un s&rsquo;hi pot acostumar—, sinó que aquesta criatura embotada no respon als cops amb cap so ni moviment, ni amb una mirada, sinó que només es balanceja una mica com un barril pesat.</p>
<p>El cinquè i darrer habitant de la Sala número 6 és un home de classe artesana que abans havia estat classificador a correus, un homenet prim i ros amb cara bonassa però una mica astuta. A jutjar per la mirada clara i alegre dels seus ulls calms i intel·ligents, té alguna idea agradable al cap, i guarda algun secret molt important i plaent. Té sota el coixí i sota el matalàs alguna cosa que no ensenya mai a ningú, no pas per por que se la prenguin o se la robin, sinó per modèstia. De vegades va a la finestra, i girant l&rsquo;esquena als companys, es posa alguna cosa al pit, i abaixant el cap, la mira; si algú s&rsquo;hi acosta en aquest moment, es turbul·la i s&rsquo;arrenca de cop alguna cosa del pit. Però no és difícil endevinar el seu secret.</p>
<p>—Felicita&rsquo;m —li diu sovint a Ivan Dmitritx—; m&rsquo;han concedit l&rsquo;orde de Sant Stanisław de segon grau amb estrella. El segon grau amb estrella només se&rsquo;ls dóna als estrangers, però per alguna raó volen fer una excepció amb mi —diu amb un somriure, encongint les espatlles amb perplexitat—. Això, ho confesso, no me l&rsquo;esperava.</p>
<p>—Jo d&rsquo;això no n&rsquo;entenc res —replica Ivan Dmitritx amb mal humor.</p>
<p>—Però saps què aconseguiré tard o d&rsquo;hora? —insisteix l&rsquo;antic classificador, fent l&rsquo;ullet amb malícia—. Segur que obtindré l&rsquo;«Estrella Polar» sueca. És una orde que val la pena de treballar-hi, una creu blanca amb una cinta negra. És molt bonica.</p>
<p>Probablement en cap altre lloc la vida no és tan monòtona com en aquesta sala. Al matí els malalts, excepte el paralític i el pagès gras, es renten al rebedor en una palangana gran i s&rsquo;eixuguen amb les faldilles dels seus bates; després beuen te en tasses de llauna que els porta Nikita de l&rsquo;edifici principal. A cadascú se li permet una tassa. Al migdia mengen sopa de col agra i gra bullit; al vespre el sopar consisteix en el gra que ha sobrat del dinar. En els intervals es giren, dormen, miren per la finestra i van d&rsquo;un racó a l&rsquo;altre. I així cada dia. Fins i tot l&rsquo;antic classificador sempre parla de les mateixes ordes.</p>
<p>Rares vegades es veuen cares noves a la Sala número 6. El metge fa temps que no hi interna cap malalt mental nou, i les persones aficionades a visitar manicòmis són poques en aquest món. Un cop cada dos mesos apareix a la sala Semion Làzaritx, el barber. Com els talla els cabells als malalts, i com l&rsquo;ajuda en Nikita, i quina commoció provoca sempre entre els bojos l&rsquo;arribada del barber borratxo i somrient, no ho descriurem.</p>
<p>Ningú més no entra a la sala excepte el barber. Els malalts estan condemnats a veure dia rere dia només en Nikita.</p>
<p>Tanmateix, darrerament circula un rumor força estrany per l&rsquo;hospital.</p>
<p>Es rumoreja que el metge ha començat a visitar la Sala número 6.</p>
<h2>V</h2>
<p>Un rumor estrany!</p>
<p>El doctor Andrei Iefímitx Raguin és, a la seva manera, un home estrany. Diuen que de jove era molt religiós, i que es preparava per a la carrera eclesiàstica, i que quan va acabar els estudis al liceu el 1863 tenia intenció d&rsquo;entrar al seminari teològic, però que el seu pare, cirurgià i doctor en medicina, se&rsquo;n va riure i va declarar sense embuts que el desheredaria si es feia capellà.

<p>Quan Andrei Iefímitx va arribar a la ciutat per fer-se càrrec de les seves obligacions, la &ldquo;institució fundada per a la glòria de Déu&rdquo; es trobava en un estat deplorable. A penes es podia respirar per la pudor que regnava a les sales, als passadissos i als patis de l&rsquo;hospital. Els empleats de l&rsquo;hospital, les infermeres i els seus fills dormien a les sales juntament amb els malalts. Es queixaven que no hi havia manera de viure amb els escarabats, les xinxes i els ratolins. Les sales de cirurgia mai no estaven lliures d&rsquo;erisipela. Hi havia només dos bisturís i ni un sol termòmetre a tot l&rsquo;hospital; guardaven les patates a les banyeres. El superintendent, l&rsquo;encarregada de la intendència i l&rsquo;ajudant mèdic robaven els malalts, i del metge anterior, el predecessor d&rsquo;Andrei Iefímitx, la gent deia que venia en secret l&rsquo;alcohol de l&rsquo;hospital i que mantenia un veritable harem format per infermeres i pacients femenines. Aquests desordres eren perfectament coneguts a la ciutat, i fins i tot exagerats, però la gent se&rsquo;ls prenia amb calma; alguns els justificaven amb el pretext que a l&rsquo;hospital només hi havia pagesos i obrers, que no podien estar descontents, ja que estaven molt pitjor a casa seva que a l&rsquo;hospital —no se&rsquo;ls podia donar de menjar becades! D&rsquo;altres deien com a excusa que la ciutat sola, sense ajuda del zemstvo, no podia mantenir un bon hospital; gràcies a Déu que en tenia un, encara que fos dolent. I el zemstvo de recent formació tampoc no obria infermeries ni a la ciutat ni als voltants, confiant en el fet que la ciutat ja tenia el seu hospital.</p>
<p>Després d&rsquo;inspeccionar l&rsquo;hospital, Andréi Iefímitx va arribar a la conclusió que era una institució immoral i extremadament perjudicial per a la salut dels habitants del poble. En la seva opinió, el més sensat que es podia fer era alliberar els pacients i tancar l&rsquo;hospital. Però va reflexionar que la seva voluntat sola no bastava per fer-ho, i que seria inútil; si la impuresa física i moral s&rsquo;expulsava d&rsquo;un lloc, no faria més que traslladar-se a un altre; calia esperar que es marcís per si sola. A més, si la gent obria un hospital i es resignava a tenir-lo, devia ser perquè el necessitava; la superstició i tota la brutícia i les abominacions de la vida quotidiana eren necessàries, ja que amb el temps es transformaven en alguna cosa sensata, igual que l&rsquo;adob es converteix en terra negra. No hi havia res a la terra tan bo que no tingués alguna cosa de fastigós en el seu origen primer.</p>
<p>Quan Andrei Iefímitx va assumir les seves funcions, aparentment no es va preocupar gaire per les irregularitats de l&rsquo;hospital. Només va demanar als cambrers i les infermeres que no dormissin a les sales, i va fer instal·lar dos armaris d&rsquo;instruments; el superintendent, l&rsquo;economa, l&rsquo;ajudant mèdic i l&rsquo;erisipela van continuar sense canvis.</p>
<p>Andrei Iefímitx estimava intensament la intel·ligència i l&rsquo;honestedat, però no tenia força de voluntat ni confiança en el seu dret a organitzar una vida intel·ligent i honesta al seu voltant. Era absolutament incapaç de donar ordres, de prohibir coses i d&rsquo;insistir. Semblava com si hagués fet vot de no alçar mai la veu i de no fer mai ús de l&rsquo;imperatiu. Li costava dir «Porta» o «Duu»; quan volia menjar tossia amb vacil·lació i deia a la cuinera: «Què tal el te?&hellip;» o «Què tal el sopar?&hellip;» Acomiadar el superintendent o dir-li que deixés de robar, o abolir completament aquell càrrec parasitari innecessari, estava absolutament fora del seu abast. Quan enganyaven o adulaven Andrei Iefímitx, o li portaven comptes que ell sabia que estaven manipulats perquè els signés, es posava vermell com un cranc i se sentia culpable, però tot i així signava els comptes. Quan els malalts es queixaven que tenien gana o de la rudesa de les infermeres, es confonia i murmurava amb sentiment de culpa: «Molt bé, molt bé, ja hi miraré més endavant&hellip; Segurament hi ha algun malentès&hellip;»</p>
<p>Al principi, Andrei Iefímitx treballava amb gran zel. Visitava malalts cada dia del matí fins a l&rsquo;hora de dinar, practicava operacions i fins i tot assistia parts. Les dones deien que era atent i hàbil diagnosticant malalties, especialment les de dones i nens. Però amb el temps la feina sens dubte el va cansar per la seva monotonia i inutilitat evident.</p>
<p>Avui veus trenta pacients, demà n&rsquo;hi ha trenta-cinc, l&rsquo;endemà quaranta, i així dia rere dia, any rere any. Mentre tant, la mortalitat a la ciutat no disminuïa i els pacients no deixaven de venir. Ajudar realment quaranta pacients entre el matí i el dinar no era físicament possible. Només podia portar a l&rsquo;engany.</p>
<p>Si es visitaven dotze mil pacients en un any, dit d&rsquo;una manera simple, això significava que dotze mil homes eren enganyats. Posar els malalts greus a les sales i tractar-los segons els principis de la ciència també era impossible. Hi havia principis, però no hi havia ciència. Si hagués de deixar de banda la filosofia i seguir pedantment les regles com els altres metges, el que calia sobretot era neteja i ventilació en lloc de brutícia, aliment sa en lloc de brou de col àcida i pudenta, i bons assistents en lloc de lladres.</p>
<p>I, de fet, per què impedir que la gent mori si la mort és el final normal i legítim de tothom? Què es guanya si algun botiguer o empleat viu cinc anys més?</p>
<p>Oprimit per aquestes reflexions, Andrei Efímitx va afluixar els seus esforços i va deixar de visitar l&rsquo;hospital cada dia.</p>
<h2>VI</h2>
<p>La seva vida transcorria d&rsquo;aquesta manera. Per regla general es llevava a les vuit del matí, es vestia i prenia el te. Després s&rsquo;asseia al seu despatx per llegir, o anava a l&rsquo;hospital. A l&rsquo;hospital els malalts externs seien al corredor fosc i estret esperant que el metge els visitués. Les infermeres i els auxiliars, trepitjant amb les botes sobre el terra de maó, passaven corrents al seu costat; pacients d&rsquo;aspecte esquelètic en bata passejaven; portaven cadàvers i recipients plens d&rsquo;immundícia; els nens ploraven, i hi havia un corrent d&rsquo;aire fred. Andrei Efímitx sabia que aquest ambient era una tortura per als malalts febrosos, tuberculosos i impressionables; però què es podia fer? A la consulta el rebia el seu ajudant, Serguei Serguéitx: un home petit i gras amb el rostre carnós, ben rentat i afaitat, de maneres suaus i afables, que portava un vestit nou i ample i que semblava més aviat un senador que no pas un ajudant mèdic. Tenia una clientela immensa a la ciutat, portava corbata blanca i es considerava més expert que el metge, que no tenia clientela. Al racó de la consulta hi havia una gran icona en un sagrari amb una làmpada pesant al davant, i a prop una canelobra amb una coberta blanca. A les parets penjaven retrats de bisbes, una vista del monestir de Sviatogorsk i corones de blauets secs. Serguei Serguéitx era religiós i li agradaven la solemnitat i el decòrum. La icona l&rsquo;havia col·locada a expenses seves; sota les seves instruccions algun dels pacients llegia els himnes d&rsquo;alabança a la consulta els diumenges, i després de la lectura el mateix Serguei Serguéitx passava pels pavellons amb un encenser cremant encens.</p>
<p>Hi havia molts malalts, però el temps era escàs, i així el treball es limitava a fer unes poques preguntes breus i administrar alguns medicaments, com oli de ricí o pomada volàtil. Andrei Iefímitx s&rsquo;asseia amb el galta recolzat a la mà, perdut en els seus pensaments i fent preguntes mecànicament. Serguei Sergueïtx també s&rsquo;asseia, fregant-se les mans i, de tant en tant, dient la seva.</p>
<p>«Patim dolor i pobresa», deia, «perquè no preguem al Déu misericordiós com caldria. Sí!»</p>
<p>Andrei Iefímitx mai no feia cap operació quan visitava els malalts; feia temps que havia deixat de fer-ho, i la vista de la sang l&rsquo;alterava. Quan havia d&rsquo;obrir la boca d&rsquo;un infant per mirar-li la gola, i la criatura plorava i tractava de defensar-se amb les seves manetes, el soroll li feia girar el cap i li portava llàgrimes als ulls. S&rsquo;afanyava a receptar un medicament i feia un gest a la dona perquè se n&rsquo;emportés l&rsquo;infant.</p>
<p>Aviat es va cansar de la timidesa dels pacients i de la seva incoherència, de la proximitat del pietós Serguei Serguèievitx, dels retrats de les parets i de les seves pròpies preguntes que havia fet una vegada i una altra durant vint anys. I se&rsquo;n va anar després d&rsquo;haver vist cinc o sis pacients. La resta els visitaria el seu ajudant en la seva absència.</p>
<p>Amb l&rsquo;agradable pensament que, gràcies a Déu, ja no tenia consulta privada i que ningú no l&rsquo;interrompria, Andrei Iefímitx es va asseure a la taula tan bon punt va arribar a casa i va agafar un llibre. Llegia molt i sempre amb gust. La meitat del sou se li anava a comprar llibres, i de les sis habitacions que formaven la seva llar, tres estaven plenes de llibres i revistes velles. Li agradaven sobretot les obres d&rsquo;història i filosofia; l&rsquo;única publicació mèdica a la qual estava subscrit era <em>El Doctor</em>, del qual sempre llegia primer les darreres pàgines. Sempre seguia llegint durant hores sense parar i sense cansar-se. No llegia tan ràpidament i impulsivament com havia fet Ivan Dmítritx en el passat, sinó lentament i amb concentració, sovint parant-se en un passatge que li agradava o que no trobava intel·ligible. Al costat dels llibres sempre hi havia una gerra de vodka, i al seu costat, no en un plat sinó damunt la tela verda de la taula, hi havia un cogombre salat o una poma confitada. Cada mitja hora es vessava una copa de vodka i se la bevia sense apartar els ulls del llibre. Després, sense mirar-hi, tastejava el cogombre i en mossegava un tros.</p>
<p>A les tres anava cautelosament fins a la porta de la cuina; tossia i deia: &ldquo;Dariuxka, què fem per dinar?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Després del dinar —més aviat pobre i servit sense gaire cura— Andrei Iefímitx passejava per les seves habitacions amb els braços creuats, pensatiu. El rellotge tocava les quatre, després les cinc, i ell encara passejava amunt i avall, pensant. De tant en tant la porta de la cuina grinyolava i apareixia la cara vermella i endormiscada de Dariuxka.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andrei Iefímitx, no és hora que es prengui la cervesa?&rdquo; li preguntava amb inquietud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, encara no és hora&hellip;&rdquo; responia ell. &ldquo;Esperaré una mica&hellip; Esperaré una mica&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cap al vespre venia el director de correus, Mikhaïl Averiànitx, l&rsquo;única persona del poble la companyia de la qual no avorria Andrei Iefímitx. Mikhaïl Averiànitx havia estat un terratinent molt ric i havia servit a la cavalleria, però s&rsquo;havia arruïnat i la pobresa l&rsquo;havia obligat a acceptar una feina a l&rsquo;oficina de correus ja entrada la vellesa. Tenia un aspecte sa i robust, bigotis grisos exuberants, els modals d&rsquo;un home ben educat i una veu forta i agradable. Era de bon cor i emotiu, però de caràcter irascible. Quan algú a l&rsquo;oficina de correus protestava, expressava desacord o fins i tot començava a discutir, Mikhaïl Averiànitx es posava vermell com un tomàquet, tremolava de dalt a baix i cridava amb veu de tro: &ldquo;Calleu!&rdquo; Així l&rsquo;oficina de correus gaudia feia temps de la fama de ser una institució que feia por visitar. Mikhaïl Averiànitx estimava i respectava Andrei Iefímitx per la seva cultura i la noblesa de la seva ànima; tractava els altres habitants del poble amb altivesa, com si fossin els seus subordinats.</p>
<p>—Aquí em teniu —deia, entrant a veure Andrei Iefímitx—. Bona tarda, amic meu! Segurament ja us estic avorrind, oi que sí?</p>
<p>—Tot el contrari, em fa molta alegria —responia el metge—. Sempre em plau veure-us.</p>
<p>Els amics s&rsquo;asseia al sofà de l&rsquo;estudi i fumaven en silenci durant una estona.</p>
<p>—Dariuixka, què fem amb la cervesa? —deia Andrei Iefímitx.</p>
<p>Es bevien la primera ampolla encara en silenci, el metge abstret i Mikhaïl Averiànitx amb la cara alegre i animada, com un home que té alguna cosa molt interessant per explicar. El metge era sempre qui començava la conversa.</p>
<p>—Quina llàstima —deia en veu baixa i pausada, sense mirar l&rsquo;amic a la cara (mai no mirava ningú a la cara)—, quina gran llàstima que a la nostra ciutat no hi hagi ningú capaç de mantenir una conversa intel·ligent i interessant, o que es prengui la molèstia de fer-ho. És una privació immensa per a nosaltres. Fins i tot les classes cultes no s&rsquo;alcen per damunt de la vulgaritat; el seu nivell de desenvolupament, us asseguro, no és ni un pèl més alt que el de les classes populars.</p>
<p>—Absolutament cert. Hi estic d&rsquo;acord.</p>
<p>—Ja sabeu, és clar —va prosseguir el doctor en veu baixa i pausada—, que tot en aquest món és insignificant i sense interès, excepte les manifestacions espirituals superiors de la ment humana. La intel·ligència traça una línia nítida entre els animals i l&rsquo;home, suggereix la divinitat d&rsquo;aquest últim i, fins i tot, en certa manera, fa les vegades de la immortalitat que no existeix. Per tant, la intel·ligència és l&rsquo;única font possible de gaudi. Al nostre voltant no veiem ni sentim cap rastre d&rsquo;intel·ligència, de manera que estem privats de gaudi. Tenim llibres, és cert, però això no és gens el mateix que la conversa viva i el diàleg. Si em permeteu una comparació no del tot encertada: els llibres són la partitura impresa, mentre que la conversa és el cant.</p>
<p>—Tens tota la raó.</p>
<p>Seguia un silenci. Darià sortia de la cuina i, amb una expressió de desànim absolut, es quedava dreta al llindar escoltant, amb la cara recolzada al puny.</p>
<p>—Eh! —sospirava Mikhaïl Averiànitx—. Com vols que aquesta generació tingui seny!</p>
<p>I es posava a descriure com havia estat la vida en el passat: sana, entretinguda i interessant. Quina intel·ligència tenia abans la classe culta de Rússia, i quines idees tan elevades sobre l&rsquo;honor i l&rsquo;amistat; com es prestaven diners sense pagaré, i es considerava una vergonya no donar cop de mà a un company necessitat; i quines campanyes, quines aventures, quines escaramusses, quins companys, quines dones! I el Caucas, quin país tan meravellós! L&rsquo;esposa d&rsquo;un comandant de batalló, una dona estranya, es posava l&rsquo;uniforme d&rsquo;oficial i marxava cap a les muntanyes al vespre, sola, sense guia. Es deia que mantenia una relació amorosa amb algun princepet del poble natiu.</p>
<p>—Reina dels Cels, Mare Santa&hellip; —suspirava la Darúixka.</p>
<p>—I com bevíem! I com menjàvem! I quins liberals desesperats érem!</p>
<p>Andrei Iefímitx l&rsquo;escoltava sense sentir-lo. Reflexionava tot tastant cervesa a poc a poc.</p>
<p>—Sovint somio amb intel·lectuals i conversar amb ells —digué de sobte, interrompent Mikhaïl Averiànitx—. El meu pare em va donar una educació excel·lent, però sota la influència de les idees dels seixanta em va fer metge. Crec que si no l&rsquo;hagués obeït aleshores, ara estaria al mateix cor del moviment intel·lectual. Molt probablement m&rsquo;hauria fet membre d&rsquo;alguna universitat. És clar que l&rsquo;intel·lecte també és transitori i no etern, però ja saps per què la tinc en especial estima. La vida és una trampa vexatòria. Quan un home reflexiu arriba a la maduresa i assoleix la plena consciència, no pot evitar sentir que és en una trampa de la qual no hi ha escapatòria. En efecte, és cridat sense haver-ho escollit per circumstàncies fortuïtes del no-res cap a la vida&hellip; per què? Tracta de descobrir el sentit i l&rsquo;objecte de la seva existència. No li diuen res, o li diuen absurditats. Truca i no li obren. La mort li arriba —també sense haver-ho escollit. I així, igual que a la presó els homes units per una desgràcia comuna se senten més tranquils quan són junts, un no s&rsquo;adona de la trampa de la vida quan la gent amb inclinació per l&rsquo;anàlisi i la generalització es troba i passa el temps intercanviant idees altives i lliures. En aquest sentit, l&rsquo;intel·lecte és la font d&rsquo;un gaudi que</p>

<h2>VII</h2>
<p>Després d&rsquo;acomiadar el seu amic, Andrei Ièfimitx s&rsquo;asseia a taula i reprenia la lectura. El silenci del vespre, i després de la nit, no es trencava amb cap so, i semblava que el temps s&rsquo;hagués aturat i rumiessin junts, el doctor i el llibre, i com si no existís res més al món que els llibres i la llàntia amb la pantalla verda. El rostre aspre del metge, de trets pagesos, s&rsquo;anava il·luminant gradualment amb un somriure de delícia i entusiasme davant el progrés de l&rsquo;intel·lecte humà. Ai, per què l&rsquo;home no és immortal?, pensava. De què serveixen els centres cerebrals i les circumvolucions, de què la vista, la parla, la consciència de si mateix, el geni, si tot està destinat a tornar a la terra i, a la fi, refredar-se juntament amb l&rsquo;escorça terrestre, per després, durant milions d&rsquo;anys, volar amb la Terra al voltant del sol sense sentit ni objecte? Per a això no calia gens treure l&rsquo;home amb el seu intel·lecte sublim, gairebé diví, del no-res, per després, com en una burla, convertir-lo en fang. La transmutació de les substàncies! Però quina covardia consolar-se amb aquest substitut barat de la immortalitat! Els processos inconscients que tenen lloc a la natura són encara més baixos que l&rsquo;estupidesa humana, ja que en l&rsquo;estupidesa hi ha, almenys, consciència i voluntat, mentre que en aquells processos no hi ha absolutament res. Només el covard que té més por de la mort que dignitat es pot consolar amb el fet que el seu cos viurà altre cop, amb el temps, en l&rsquo;herba, en les pedres, en el gripau. Trobar la pròpia immortalitat en la transmutació de les substàncies és tan estrany com profetitzar un futur brillant per a l&rsquo;estoig després que un violí preciós s&rsquo;hagi trencat i sigui inservible.</p>

<p>D&rsquo;altra banda, sabia perfectament que s&rsquo;havia produït un canvi màgic en la medicina durant els darrers vint-i-cinc anys. Quan estudiava a la universitat havia imaginat que la medicina aviat seria superada pel destí de l&rsquo;alquímia i la metafísica; però ara, quan llegia de nit, la ciència mèdica el tocava i despertava la seva admiració, fins i tot el seu entusiasme. Quina brillantor inesperada, quina revolució! Gràcies al sistema antisèptic es practicaven operacions que el gran Pirogov havia considerat impossibles fins i tot <em>in spe</em> (teòricament). Metges ordinaris del zemstvo s&rsquo;atrevien a dur a terme la resecció de la ròtula; de les operacions abdominals només l&rsquo;un per cent era fatal; mentre que els càlculs es consideraven una cosa tan banal que ni tan sols n&rsquo;escrivien. S&rsquo;havia descobert una cura radical per a la sífilis. I la teoria de l&rsquo;herència, l&rsquo;hipnotisme, els descobriments de Pasteur i de Koch, la higiene basada en estadístiques, i el treball dels metges del zemstvo!</p>
<p>La psiquiatria, amb la seva classificació moderna de les malalties mentals, els seus mètodes de diagnòstic i tractament, era un Elbrus perfecte en comparació amb el que havia estat en el passat. Ja no vessaven aigua freda al cap als malalts mentals ni els posaven camises de força. Els tractaven amb humanitat i fins i tot organitzaven balls i espectacles. Andrei Iefímitx sabia que amb els gustos i les idees modernes, una abominació com la Sala número 6 només era possible a cent cinquanta verstes d&rsquo;un ferrocarril. En una ciutat petita on l&rsquo;alcalde i tot l&rsquo;ajuntament eren comerciants semianalfabets que veien en el metge un oracle al qual calia creure sense cap crítica, fins i tot si els hagués vessat plom fos a la boca. En qualsevol altre lloc, el públic i els diaris ja haurien destruït aquesta petita Bastilla.</p>
<p>«Però, al cap i a la fi, què importa?», es preguntava Andrei Iefímitx, obrint els ulls. «Hi ha el sistema antisèptic, hi ha Koch, hi ha Pasteur, però la realitat essencial no ha canviat gens; la malaltia i la mortalitat segueixen igual. Organitzen balls i espectacles per als bojos, però encara no els deixen anar lliures; de manera que tot plegat és disbarat i vanitat, i en el fons no hi ha cap diferència entre la millor clínica de Viena i el meu hospital.» Però la tristor i un sentiment semblant a l&rsquo;enveja li impedien romandre indiferent; devia ser per l&rsquo;esgotament. El cap pesant li va caure sobre el llibre, es va posar les mans sota la cara per fer-se-la més tova, i va pensar: «Serveixo en una institució perniciosa i cobro un sou de gent a qui estic enganyant. No soc honest, però, al remat, jo mateix no soc res, només soc part d&rsquo;un mal social inevitable: tots els funcionaris locals són perniciosos i cobren el sou sense fer res&hellip; I així, per la meva falta d&rsquo;honestedat no he de culpar-me jo, sinó els temps&hellip; Si hagués nascut dos-cents anys més tard hauria estat diferent&hellip;»</p>
<p>Quan tocaven les tres apagava el llum i se n&rsquo;anava a la cambra; no tenia son.</p>
<h2>VIII</h2>
<p>Dos anys abans, el zemstvo en un moment d&rsquo;esperit liberal havia decidit assignar tres-cents rubles a l&rsquo;any per pagar un servei mèdic addicional a la ciutat fins que s&rsquo;obrís l&rsquo;hospital del zemstvo, i el metge de districte, Ievgueni Fiódorovitx Khobótov, fou convidat a la ciutat per assistir Andrei Iefímitx. Era un home molt jove —no havia complert encara els trenta anys—, alt i morè, amb els pòmuls amples i els ulls petits; els seus avantpassats probablement procedien d&rsquo;alguna de les moltes races alienes de Rússia. Arribà a la ciutat sense ni un kopek, amb una petita maleta i una dona jove i senzilla que ell anomenava la seva cuinera. Aquesta dona portava un nadó al pit. Ievgueni Fiódorovitx acostumava a anar amb una gorra amb visera i botes altes, i a l&rsquo;hivern duia un pellís. Es féu molt amic de Serguei Serguéievitx, l&rsquo;ajudant mèdic, i del tresorer, però es mantenia apartat dels altres funcionaris, i per alguna raó els anomenava aristòcrates. Només tenia un llibre al seu allotjament: «Les últimes receptes de la Clínica de Viena de 1881». Quan anava a veure un pacient sempre s&rsquo;emportava aquest llibre. Al vespre jugava al billar al club; no li agradaven les cartes. Li agradava molt usar en la conversació expressions com ara «embolic sense fi», «corda sabonosa», «calla&rsquo;t amb les teves remilgades&hellip;»</p>
<p>Visitava l&rsquo;hospital dos cops per setmana, feia la ronda per les sales i veia els pacients externs. La completa absència de tractament antisèptic i les ventoses li provocaven indignació, però no va introduir cap sistema nou, per por d&rsquo;ofendre Andrei Iefímitx. Considerava el seu col·lega un vell brivall astut, sospitava que era un home de recursos considerables i l&rsquo;enviava en secret. Li hauria agradat molt tenir el seu càrrec.</p>
<h2>IX</h2>
<p>Un vespre de primavera cap a finals de març, quan ja no quedava neu al terra i els estornells cantaven al jardí de l&rsquo;hospital, el metge va sortir a acomiadar el seu amic el cap de correus fins a la porta. En aquell mateix moment, el jueu Moiseika, que tornava amb el seu botí, va entrar al pati. No duia barret, i els peus descalços els tenia ficats dins unes galoixes; a la mà portava un saquet de monedes de coure.</p>
<p>—Doneu-me un copec! —li va dir al metge, somrient i tremolant de fred. Andrei Iefímitx, que mai no era capaç de negar res a ningú, li va donar una moneda de deu copecs.</p>
<p>«Què malament que està!», va pensar, mirant els peus descalços del jueu amb els turmells prims i vermellosos. «I això que està humit».</p>
<p>I mogut per un sentiment que participava alhora de la pietat i del fàstic, va entrar al pavelló darrere del jueu, fixant-se ara en el seu cap calb, ara en els turmells. Quan el metge va entrar, Nikita va saltar de dalt del munt de palla i es va posar ferm.</p>
<p>—Bon dia, Nikita —va dir Andrei Iefímitx amb suavitat—. Aquest jueu hauria de tenir botes o alguna cosa, agafarà fred.</p>
<p>—És clar, senyor. Ho comunicaré al superintendent.</p>
<p>—Si us plau, feu-ho; demaneu-li-ho en nom meu. Digueu-li que jo ho he demanat.</p>
<p>La porta de la sala estava oberta. Ivan Dmítritx, estirat al llit recolzat sobre el colze, va escoltar amb alarma aquella veu desconeguda, i de sobte va reconèixer el metge. Va tremolar de cap a peus de còlera, va saltar dempeus, i amb la cara vermella i furiosa, amb els ulls sortits de les òrbites, va córrer cap al mig del carrer.</p>

<p>—No veig cap raó especial per alegrar-me —va dir Andrei Iefímitx, que trobava teatral el gest d&rsquo;Ivan Dmitritx, tot i que l&rsquo;emocionava—. Hi continuarà havent presons i manicomis, i la veritat, tal com vós l&rsquo;acabeu d&rsquo;expressar, triomfarà; però la realitat de les coses, sabeu, no canviarà, les lleis de la natura seguiran essent les mateixes. La gent patirà dolor, envellirà i morirà igual que ara. Per magnífic que fos l&rsquo;alba que il·luminés la vostra vida, al final us clavarien dins d&rsquo;un taüt i us llencarien en un forat.</p>
<p>—I la immortalitat?</p>
<p>—Ai, vinga ja!</p>
<p>—Vós no hi creieu, però jo sí. Algú de Dostoievski o de Voltaire va dir que si Déu no hagués existit, els homes l&rsquo;haurien inventat. I jo crec fermament que si no hi ha immortalitat, el gran intel·lecte de l&rsquo;home tard o d&rsquo;hora la inventarà.</p>
<p>—Ben dit —observà Andrei Iefímitx, somrient de gust—; és una sort que tinguis fe. Amb una creença així es pot viure feliç fins i tot tancat entre parets. Suposo que has estudiat en algun lloc?</p>
<p>—Sí, he anat a la universitat, però no vaig acabar els estudis.</p>
<p>—Ets un home reflexiu i pensador. En qualsevol circumstància pots trobar la tranquil·litat dins teu. El pensament lliure i profund que aspira a comprendre la vida, i el menyspreu complet per l&rsquo;estúpida agitació del món&hellip; aquests són dos béns superiors a qualsevol altre que l&rsquo;home hagi conegut mai. I els pots posseir fins i tot vivint darrere triple reixat. Diògenes vivia en un barril, però era més feliç que tots els reis de la terra.</p>
<p>—El teu Diògenes era un capficat —digué Ivan Dmitritx amb mal humor—. Per què em parles de Diògenes i d&rsquo;alguna estúpida comprensió de la vida? —cridà, enfurint-se de sobte i aixecant-se d&rsquo;un salt—. Jo estimo la vida; l&rsquo;estimo apassionadament. Tinc la mania de la persecució, un terror agonitzant i constant; però tinc moments en què em sent aclaparat per la set de vida, i aleshores tinc por d&rsquo;embogir. Vull viure desesperadament, desesperadament!</p>
<p>Es passejava amunt i avall per la sala, agitat, i va dir, baixant la veu: </p>
<p>—Quan somio em persegueixen fantasmes. Ve gent a veure&rsquo;m, sento veus i música, i m&rsquo;imagino que camino per boscos o vora mar, i desitjo tan apassionadament el moviment, els interessos&hellip; Apa, diga&rsquo;m, quines notícies hi ha? —preguntà Ivan Dmitritx—. Què passa?</p>
<p>—Vol saber coses del poble o en general?</p>
<p>—Bé, expliqui&rsquo;m primer del poble, i després en general.</p>
<p>—Doncs, al poble hi ha un avorriment espantós&hellip; No hi ha ningú amb qui dir una paraula, ningú a qui escoltar. No arriba gent nova. Fa poc ha vingut un metge jove que es diu Hobotov.</p>
<p>—Ja hi era quan jo encara&hellip; Bé, és un pallús de mala raça, oi?</p>
<p>—Sí, és un home sense cultura. És estrany, sap?&hellip; Per tot el que es veu, a les nostres capitals no hi ha estancament intel·lectual; hi ha moviment, així que també hi ha d&rsquo;haver gent autèntica; però per alguna raó sempre ens envien homes com aquest que jo preferiria no veure. És un poble condemnat a la mala sort!</p>
<p>—Sí, és una ciutat desgraciada —va suspirar Ivan Dmitritx, i va riure.
—I com van les coses en general? Què escriuen als diaris i a les revistes?</p>
<p>Ja s&rsquo;havia fet fosc a la sala. El metge es va aixecar i, dempeus, va començar a descriure el que s&rsquo;escrivia a l&rsquo;estranger i a Rússia, i la tendència de pensament que es podia notar ara. Ivan Dmitritx escoltava atentament i feia preguntes, però de sobte, com si recordés alguna cosa terrible, es va agafar el cap i es va ajeure al llit d&rsquo;esquena al metge.</p>
<p>—Què passa? —va preguntar Andrei Iefímitx.</p>
<p>—No sentireu ni una paraula més de mi —va dir Ivan Dmitritx bruscament—. Deixeu-me en pau.</p>
<p>—Per què?</p>
<p>—Us dic que em deixeu en pau. Per què dimonis insistiu?</p>
<p>Andrei Iefímitx va encorvir les espatlles, va suspirar fondament i va sortir. Quan travessava el rebedor va dir:
—Hauríeu de netejar aquí, Nikita&hellip; hi ha una pudor espantosa.</p>
<p>—Naturalment, senyor doctor.</p>
<p>«Quin noi tan agradable!», pensà Andrei Efímitx tornant cap al seu pis. «En tots els anys que fa que visc aquí, crec que és el primer amb qui es pot parlar. És capaç de raonar i té inquietuds intel·lectuals.»</p>
<p>Mentre llegia, i després, mentre s&rsquo;anava a dormir, no deixava de pensar en Ivan Dmítritx, i quan es despertà l&rsquo;endemà al matí recordà que el dia abans havia conegut un home intel·ligent i interessant, i decidí anar-lo a visitar de nou com més aviat millor.</p>
<h2>X</h2>
<p>Ivan Dmítritx jeia en la mateixa posició que el dia anterior, amb el cap entre les mans i les cames encongides. No se li veia la cara.</p>
<p>—Bon dia, amic meu —digué Andrei Efímitx—. Estàs despert?</p>
<p>—Primer de tot, jo no sóc amic vostre —va articular Ivan Dmitritx contra el coixí—; i segon, els vostres esforços són inútils; no en traureu ni una paraula.</p>
<p>—Estrany —va murmurar Andrei Iefímitx, confós—. Ahir vam parlar tranquil·lament, però de sobte, per alguna raó, us vau ofendre i ho vau tallar tot d&rsquo;una&hellip; Probablement em vaig expressar malament, o potser vaig fer alguna observació que no s&rsquo;ajustava a les vostres conviccions&hellip;</p>
<p>—Sí, quina observació més probable! —va dir Ivan Dmitritx, incorporant-se i mirant el metge amb ironia i inquietud. Tenia els ulls vermells—. Podeu anar a espiar i a furgar a un altre lloc, aquí no us serveix de res. Ahir ja sabia per què havíeu vingut.</p>
<p>—Quina fantasia tan estranya —va riure el metge—. Així que suposeu que sóc un espia?</p>

<p>Era entre les quatre i les cinc de la tarda, l&rsquo;hora en què Andrei Iefímitx solia passejar amunt i avall per les seves habitacions, i la Dariuixka preguntava si no era hora de la seva cervesa. Era un dia serè i lluent.</p>
<p>—He sortit a passejar després de dinar, i aquí he vingut, com veus —va dir el metge—. Ja és primavera del tot.</p>
<p>—Quin mes és? Març? —va preguntar Ivan Dmítrïtx.</p>
<p>—Sí, finals de març.</p>
<p>—Hi ha molt fang?</p>
<p>—No, no gaire. Ja hi ha senders al jardí.</p>
<p>—Ara estaria bé anar en cotxe descobert cap al camp —va dir Ivan Dmítrïtx, fregant-se els ulls vermells com si acabés de despertar-se—, després tornar a casa, a un despatx càlid i acollidor, i&hellip; i tenir un metge decent que et curi el mal de cap&hellip; Fa tant de temps que no visc com un ésser humà. Aquí és repugnant! Insuportablement repugnant!</p>
<p>Després de l&rsquo;agitació del dia anterior estava esgotat i apàtic, i parlava de mala gana. Els dits li tremolaven, i pel rostre se li veia que tenia un mal de cap espantós.</p>
<p>—No hi ha cap diferència real entre un despatx càlid i acollidor i aquesta sala —digué Andrei Iefímitx—. La pau i la satisfacció de l&rsquo;home no són fora d&rsquo;ell mateix, sinó dins seu.</p>
<p>—Què vols dir?</p>
<p>—L&rsquo;home corrent busca el bé i el mal en les coses externes, és a dir, en els cotxes, en els despatxos, però l&rsquo;home que pensa ho busca en si mateix.</p>
<p>—Hauríeu d&rsquo;anar a predicar aquesta filosofia a Grècia, on fa calor i fa olor de magranes, però aquí no s&rsquo;avé al clima. Amb qui parlava de Diògenes? Era amb vós?</p>
<p>—Sí, ahir amb mi.</p>
<p>—Diògenes no necessitava cap despatx ni cap habitació calenta; allà fa calor sense més. Pots jeure en el teu barril i menjar taronges i olives. Però porta&rsquo;l a Rússia a viure: al maig ja demanaria a crit que el deixessin entrar a casa, i no parlem del desembre. Es quedaria encongit de fred.</p>
<p>—No. Hom pot ser insensible al fred com a qualsevol altre dolor. Marc Aureli diu: «Un dolor és una idea vívida del dolor; fes un esforç de voluntat per canviar aquesta idea, rebutja-la, deixa de lamentar-te, i el dolor desapareixerà.» És cert. L&rsquo;home savi, o simplement l&rsquo;home reflexiu, pensador, es distingeix precisament pel seu menyspreu del patiment; està sempre content i res no el sorprèn.</p>
<p>—Doncs jo sóc un idiota, ja que pateixo i estic descontent i em sorprèn la vilesa del gènere humà.</p>

Si el teixit orgànic és capaç de viure, ha de reaccionar a cada estímul. I jo ho faig! Al dolor responc amb llàgrimes i crits, a la baixesa amb indignació, a la brutor amb fàstic. Al meu entendre, això és justament el que s&rsquo;anomena vida. Com més baix és l&rsquo;organisme, menys sensible és i més feble és la seva reacció a l&rsquo;estímul; i com més alt, reacciona més sensiblement i vigorosament a la realitat. I tu no ho saps? Un metge, i no conèixer coses tan elementals! Per menysprear el patiment, estar sempre content i no sorprendre&rsquo;s de res, cal arribar a aquesta condició —i Ivan Dmitritx assenyalà el pagès que era una massa de greix— o endurir-se pel sofriment fins al punt de perdre tota sensibilitat —és a dir, en altres paraules, deixar de viure.

Tota la vida resideix en aquestes sensacions. Un pot sentir-s'hi oprimit, pot odiar-les, però no pot menysprear-les. Sí, doncs, ho repeteixo: la doctrina dels estoics no pot tenir mai futur.

Això és el que vull dir: un dels estoics es va vendre com a esclau per rescatar el seu veí, de manera que, ja veus, fins i tot un estoic reaccionava als estímuls, perquè, per a un acte tan generós com destruir-se un mateix pel bé del seu veí, havia de tenir una ànima capaç de compassió i indignació. Aquí a la presó he oblidat tot el que he après, si no podria recordar alguna altra cosa. Fixa&rsquo;t en Crist, per exemple: Crist va respondre a la realitat plorant, somrient, entristint-se i fins i tot irant, fins i tot abatut pel dolor.

<p>Ivan Dmitritx va riure i es va asseure. «D&rsquo;acord que la pau i la tranquil·litat de l&rsquo;home no resideixen fora sinó dins d&rsquo;ell mateix», va dir, «d&rsquo;acord que s&rsquo;ha de menysprear el patiment i no sorprendre&rsquo;s de res, però amb quina autoritat prediquesp aquesta teoria? Ets un savi? Un filòsof?»</p>
<p>«No, no sóc filòsof, però tothom hauria de predicar-la perquè és raonable.»</p>
<p>«No, vull saber com és que et consideres competent per jutjar sobre la &lsquo;comprensió&rsquo;, el menyspreu pel patiment i demés. Has patit mai? Tens alguna idea del que és patir? Permet-me preguntar-te: et van pegar de petit?»</p>
<p>«No, els meus pares sentien aversió pel càstig corporal.»</p>
<p>«El meu pare em picava cruelment; el meu pare era un funcionari dur, malaltís, amb el nas llarg i el coll groguenc. Però parlem de tu. Ningú t&rsquo;ha posat un dit a sobre en tota la teva vida, ningú t&rsquo;ha fet por ni t&rsquo;ha pegat; ets fort com un toro. Vas créixer sota l&rsquo;ala del teu pare i vas estudiar a expenses seves, i després vas caure directament en una sinecura. Durant més de vint anys has viscut sense pagar lloguer, amb calefacció, llum i servei inclosos, i has tingut el dret de treballar com t&rsquo;ha plagut i tant com t&rsquo;ha plagut, fins i tot de no fer res. Eres per naturalesa un home bla, mandrós, i per això has procurat organitzar-te la vida perquè res no et molestés ni et fes moure. Has traspassat la feina a l&rsquo;ajudant i a la resta de la colla mentre tu seu tranquil·lament i en l&rsquo;escalfor, estalvies diners, llegeixes, t&rsquo;entredeixes amb reflexions, amb tota mena de bajanades elevades, i» (Ivan Dmitritx va mirar el nas vermell del doctor) «»amb el trinc; de fet, no has vist res de la vida, no en saps absolutament res, i només coneixes la realitat de manera teòrica; menysprees el patiment i no et sorprens de res per una raó molt simple: vanitat de vanitats, l&rsquo;extern i l&rsquo;intern, menyspreu per la vida, pel patiment i per la mort, comprensió, felicitat vertadera&hellip; aquesta és la filosofia que millor s&rsquo;escau al mandrós rus. Veus un pagès que pega la seva dona, per exemple. Per què interferir? Deixa que la pegi, tots dos moriran tard o d&rsquo;hora, de tota manera; i, a més, qui pega es fa mal amb els seus cops, no a la persona que està pegant, sinó a ell mateix. Emborratxar-se és estúpid i indecorós, però si beus mors, i si no beus també mors. Una pagesa ve amb mal de queixal&hellip; i què? El dolor és la idea del dolor, i a més &lsquo;no es pot viure en aquest món sense malaltia; &lsquo;«»</p>
<p>tots morirem, i per tant vés-te&rsquo;n, dona, no m&rsquo;impedeixis pensar i beure vodka.&rsquo;&rsquo; Un jove demana consell sobre què ha de fer, com ha de viure; qualsevol altre s&rsquo;ho pensaria abans de respondre, però tu ja tens la resposta preparada: lluita per la &lsquo;comprensió&rsquo; o per la felicitat veritable. I què és aquesta fantàstica &lsquo;felicitat veritable&rsquo;? No hi ha resposta, és clar. Ens tenen aquí darrere de finestres amb barrots, ens torturen, ens deixen podrir-nos; però això està molt bé i és raonable, perquè no hi ha cap diferència entre aquesta sala i un despatx càlid i acollidor. Una filosofia ben còmoda. No pots fer res, però tens la consciència neta, i et sents savi&hellip; No, senyor, això no és filosofia, no és pensar, no és amplitud de visió, sinó peresa, faquirisme, estupefacció ensonyada. Sí —va cridar Ivan Dmitrítx, tornant-se a enfurismar—, vós menyspreeu el sofriment, però segur que si us pessigueu el dit amb la porta cridareu com un descosit.</p>
<p>&rsquo;`&rsquo;json
{
    &ldquo;traduccio&rdquo;: &ldquo;—I potser no hauria de cridar —va dir Andrei Iefímitx amb un somriure suau.\n\n—Oh, és clar! Però si tinguessis un atac de paràlisi, o suposem que algun imbècil o macarró s&rsquo;aprofités de la seva posició i rang per insultar-te en públic, i si sabés que ho pot fer amb impunitat, aleshores entendries què significa apartar la gent amb comprensió i felicitat veritable.\n\n—Això és original —va dir Andrei Iefímitx, rient amb plaer i fregant-se les mans—. M&rsquo;impressiona favorablement la teva inclinació per les generalitzacions, i l&rsquo;esbós del meu caràcter que acabes de fer és simplement brillant. He de confessar que parlar amb tu em dona un gran plaer. Bé, t&rsquo;he escoltat, i ara tu has d&rsquo;escoltar-me amb cortesia.\n\n</p>
<h2>XI</h2>
<p>La conversa es va allargar una hora més, i aparentment va causar una profunda impressió a Andrei Iefímitx. Va començar a anar a la sala cada dia. Hi anava als matins i després de dinar, i sovint el capvespre el trobava encara conversant amb Ivan Dmítritx. Al principi Ivan Dmítritx es mantenia distant, sospitava que tenia males intencions, i expressava obertament la seva hostilitat. Però després s&rsquo;hi va acostumar, i la seva manera brusca va donar pas a una ironia condescendent.</p>
<p>Aviat es va saber per tot l&rsquo;hospital que el doctor, Andrei Iefímitx, havia agafat el costum de visitar la Sala número 6. Ningú —ni Serguei Serguéitx, ni Nikita, ni les infermeres— podia concebre per què hi anava, per què s&rsquo;hi quedava hores senceres, de què parlaven, i per què no escrivia receptes. El seu comportament semblava estrany. Sovint Mikhail Averiànitx no el trobava a casa, cosa que no havia passat mai abans, i Dariúixka estava molt preocupada, perquè ara el doctor es bevia la cervesa sense hora fixa, i de vegades fins i tot arribava tard a sopar.</p>
<p>Un dia —era a finals de juny— el doctor Khobótov va anar a veure Andrei Iefímitx per alguna cosa. No el va trobar a casa, així que va anar a buscar-lo al pati; allà li van dir que el vell doctor havia anat a veure els malalts mentals. Va entrar al pavelló i es va aturar al rebedor, on va sentir la conversa següent:</p>
<p>—Mai ens posarem d&rsquo;acord, i no aconseguiràs convertir-me a la teva fe —deia Ivan Dmítritx irritat—; ignores completament la realitat, i no has conegut mai el patiment, sinó que només has viscut com una sangonera alimentant-te del sofriment dels altres, mentre jo he patit contínuament des del dia que vaig néixer fins avui. Per això, et dic francament, em considero superior a tu i més competent en tots els aspectes. No ets tu qui m&rsquo;ha d&rsquo;ensenyar.</p>
<p>—No tinc absolutament cap ambició de convertir-te a la meva fe —va dir Andrei Iefímitx suaument, i amb pena que l&rsquo;altre es negués a entendre&rsquo;l—. I això no és el que importa, amic meu; el que importa no és que tu hagis patit i jo no. L&rsquo;alegria i el sofriment passen; deixem-los estar, no els fem cas. El que importa és que tu i jo pensem; veiem l&rsquo;un en l&rsquo;altre persones capaces de pensar i raonar, i això és un vincle comú entre nosaltres per molt diferents que siguin les nostres opinions. Si saberes, amic meu, com em fa mal la insensatesa universal, la ineptitud, l&rsquo;estupidesa, i amb quina delícia parlo sempre amb tu! Ets un home intel·ligent, i gaudeixo de la teva companyia.</p>
<p>Khobótov va obrir la porta una mica i va mirar cap a la sala; Ivan Dmítritx amb el seu barret de dormir i el doctor Andrei Iefímitx eren asseguts l&rsquo;un al costat de l&rsquo;altre al llit. El boig feia ganyotes, es contreia, i s&rsquo;embolicava convulsivament amb la bata, mentre el doctor romania immòbil amb el cap ajupit, i tenia la cara roja amb un aspecte desvalgut i trist. Khobótov va encongir les espatlles, va somriure amb sarcasme, i va mirar Nikita. Nikita també va encongir les espatlles.</p>
<p>L&rsquo;endemà Khobótov va anar al pavelló, acompanyat de l&rsquo;ajudant. Els dos es van quedar al rebedor escoltant.</p>
<p>—Em sembla que el nostre vell ha perdut completament el seny! —va dir Khobótov quan va sortir del pavelló.</p>
<p>—Senyor, tingues pietat de nosaltres pecadors! —va sospirar el decorós Serguei Serguéitx, evitant acuradament els tolls per no embrutar-se les botes llustroses—. He de confessar, honorable Ievgueni Fiódoritx, que ho esperava des de fa temps.</p>
<h2>XII</h2>
<p>Després d&rsquo;això, Andrei Iefímitx va començar a notar un aire misteriós al seu voltant. Els infermers, les infermeres i els malalts el miraven amb curiositat quan se&rsquo;l trobaven, i després xiuxiuejaven entre ells. La petita Màixa, filla del director, que li agradava trobar-se pels jardins de l&rsquo;hospital, ara fugia d&rsquo;ell sense cap motiu quan s&rsquo;acostava amb un somriure per acariciar-li el cap. El cap de correus ja no deia &ldquo;Justament!&rdquo; mentre l&rsquo;escoltava, sinó que, amb una confusió inexplicable, murmurava &ldquo;Sí, sí, sí&hellip;&rdquo; i el mirava amb una expressió dolguda i pensarosa; per alguna raó, havia començat a aconsellar al seu amic que deixés el vodka i la cervesa, però com que era un home de sentiments delicats no ho deia directament, sinó que ho suggeria, explicant-li primer la història del comandant del seu batalló, un home excel·lent, i després la del capellà del regiment, un tipus estupend, tots dos que bevien i van emmalaltir, però que en deixar completament la beguda van recuperar la salut. Dues o tres vegades Andrei Iefímitx va rebre la visita del seu col·lega Khobòtov, que també li va aconsellar que deixés les begudes alcohòliques i, sense cap motiu aparent, li va recomanar que prengués bromur.</p>
<p>A l&rsquo;agost, Andrei Iefímitx va rebre una carta de l&rsquo;alcalde de la ciutat demanant-li que vingués per un assumpte molt important. En arribar a l&rsquo;ajuntament a l&rsquo;hora fixada, Andrei Iefímitx hi va trobar el comandant militar, el director de l&rsquo;escola del districte, un membre del consell municipal, Khobòtov i un senyor corpulent i ros que li van presentar com a metge. Aquest metge, amb un cognom polonès difícil de pronunciar, vivia en una granja de cavalls de purasang a vint milles de distància i ara era de visita a la ciutat.</p>
<p>—Hi ha un assumpte que us concerneix —va dir el membre del consell municipal, dirigint-se a Andrei Iefímitx després que tots s&rsquo;haguessin saludat i s&rsquo;haguessin assegut a la taula—. Aquí Ievgueni Fiodòritx diu que no hi ha prou espai per al dispensari a l&rsquo;edifici principal i que s&rsquo;hauria de traslladar a un dels pavillons. Això no té importància&hellip; És clar que es pot traslladar, però la qüestió és que el pavelló necessita reformes.</p>
<p>—Sí, s&rsquo;hauria de reformar —va dir Andrei Iefímitx després d&rsquo;un moment de reflexió—. Si es condicionés el pavelló del racó com a dispensari, per exemple, calculo que costaria com a mínim cinc-centes rubles. Una despesa improductiva!</p>
<p>Tothom va callar durant un moment.</p>
<p>—Fa deu anys que vaig tenir l&rsquo;honor de proposar-vos —va continuar Andrei Iefímitx amb veu baixa— que l&rsquo;hospital en la seva forma actual és un luxe que supera els mitjans de la ciutat. Es va construir als quaranta, però llavors les coses eren diferents. La ciutat gasta massa en edificis innecessaris i personal superflu. Crec que amb un sistema diferent es podrien mantenir dos hospitals modèlics amb els mateixos diners.</p>
<p>—Doncs tinguem un sistema diferent! —va dir vivaç el membre del consell municipal.</p>
<p>—Ja vaig tenir l&rsquo;honor de proposar-vos que el departament mèdic passés a la supervisió del zemstvo.</p>
<p>—Sí, transferiu els diners al zemstvo i se&rsquo;ls robaran —va riure el metge ros.</p>
<p>—Sempre acaba igual —va assentir el membre del consell, i també va riure.</p>
<p>Andrei Iefímitx va mirar el metge ros amb ulls apàtics i sense brillantor i va dir:
—Cal ser just.</p>
<p>Hi va haver un altre silenci. Van portar el te. El comandant militar, per alguna raó molt turbat, va tocar la mà d&rsquo;Andrei Iefímitx per damunt de la taula i va dir:
—Ens heu oblidat completament, doctor. Però és clar, sou un ermità: no jugueu a cartes i no us agraden les dones. Us avorriríeu amb tipus com nosaltres.</p>
<p>Tots van començar a dir com d&rsquo;avorrit era per a una persona decent viure en una ciutat així. Sense teatre, sense música, i en l&rsquo;últim ball del club hi havia hagut unes vint dames i només dos cavallers. Els joves no ballaven, sinó que es passaven tot el temps amuntegats al voltant del bufet o jugant a cartes.</p>
<p>Sense mirar ningú i parlant lentament amb veu baixa, Andrei Iefímitx va començar a dir quina llàstima, quina llàstima terrible era que la gent del poble malbaratés la seva energia vital, els seus cors i les seves ments amb cartes i xafarderies, i que no tingués ni la força ni la inclinació de passar el temps en converses interessants i llegint, i que refusés aprofitar els plaers de l&rsquo;esperit. Només l&rsquo;esperit era interessant i digne d&rsquo;atenció; tot la resta era baix i mesquí. Khobòtov va escoltar el seu col·lega atentament i de sobte va preguntar:</p>
<p>—Andrei Iefímitx, quin dia del mes és avui?</p>
<p>Després de rebre una resposta, el metge ros i ell, amb to d&rsquo;examinadors conscients de la seva manca de destresa, van començar a preguntar a Andrei Iefímitx quin dia de la setmana era, quants dies hi havia en un any i si era cert que hi havia un profeta extraordinari vivint a la Sala número 6.</p>
<p>En resposta a aquesta última pregunta, Andrei Iefímitx es va posar una mica vermell i va dir:
—Sí, és un malalt mental, però és un jove interessant.</p>
<p>No li van fer més preguntes.</p>
<p>Quan se estava posant l&rsquo;abric al rebedor, el comandant militar li va posar una mà a l&rsquo;espatlla i va dir amb un sospir:
—Ja és hora que nosaltres, els vells, descanséssim!</p>
<p>En sortir de la sala, Andrei Iefímitx va comprendre que havia estat un comitè nomenat per investigar el seu estat mental. Va recordar les preguntes que li havien fet, es va posar roig com un tomàquet i, per alguna raó, per primera vegada en la seva vida, va sentir una amarga pena per la ciència mèdica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Déu meu&hellip;&rdquo; va pensar, recordant com aquests metges l&rsquo;acabaven d&rsquo;examinar; &ldquo;si fa poc que escolten conferències sobre patologia mental, han aprovat un examen&hellip; Com s&rsquo;explica aquesta ignorància crassa? No tenen ni idea de patologia mental!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I per primera vegada en la seva vida es va sentir insultat i mogut per la ira.</p>
<p>Al vespre del mateix dia, Mikhaïl Averiànitx va venir a veure&rsquo;l. El cap de correus se li va acostar sense esperar a saludar-lo, el va agafar per les dues mans i va dir amb veu agitada:
—Amic meu, amic estimat, demostreu-me que creieu en el meu afecte sincer i que em considereu el vostre amic! —I impedint qu&rsquo;Andrei Iefímitx parlés, va continuar, excitant-se—: Us estimo per la vostra cultura i noblesa d&rsquo;ànima. Escolteu-me, amic meu. Les regles de la seva professió obliguen els metges a amagar-vos la veritat, però jo dic la veritat crua com un soldat. No esteu bé! Perdoneu-me, amic meu, però és la veritat; tothom que us envolta s&rsquo;ha adonat d&rsquo;això fa temps. El doctor Ievgueni Fiodòritx m&rsquo;acaba de dir que és essencial que descanséssiu i distreiguéssiu la ment per la vostra salut. Justament! Excel·lent! D&rsquo;aquí a un o dos dies agafo vacances i me&rsquo;n vaig per respirar una atmosfera diferent. Demostreu que sou el meu amic, anem-hi junts! Fem una escapada com en els bons temps!</p>
<p>—Em trobo perfectament bé —va dir Andrei Iefímitx després d&rsquo;un moment de reflexió—. No puc marxar. Permeteu-me que us demostri la meva amistat d&rsquo;una altra manera.</p>
<p>Marxar sense objectiu, sense els seus llibres, sense la seva Dariúixka, sense la seva cervesa, trencar de cop la rutina de la vida, establerta durant vint anys&hellip; La idea, al primer moment, li va semblar bojauna i fantàstica, però va recordar la conversa al comitè del zemstvo i els sentiments deprimints amb què havia tornat a casa, i el pensament d&rsquo;una breu absència de la ciutat on la gent estúpida el considerava un boig li va resultar agradable.</p>
<p>—I on teniu intenció d&rsquo;anar exactament? —va preguntar.</p>
<p>—A Moscou, a Petersburg, a Varsòvia&hellip; Vaig passar els cinc anys més feliços de la meva vida a Varsòvia. Quina ciutat meravellosa! Anem-hi, amic meu!</p>
<h2>XIII</h2>
<p>Una setmana més tard van suggerir a Andrei Iefímitx que es prengués un descans —és a dir, que presentés la dimissió—, una proposta que va rebre amb indiferència. I encara una setmana després, Mikhaïl Averiànitx i ell seien en un carruatge de posta camí de l&rsquo;estació de tren més propera. Els dies eren frescos i clars, amb un cel blau i una distància transparent. Van trigar dos dies a recórrer les cent cinquanta milles fins a l&rsquo;estació, i s&rsquo;hi van aturar dues nits pel camí. Quan a l&rsquo;hostal els gots que els donaven per al te no estaven ben rentats, o els cotxers tardaven a aparellar els cavalls, Mikhaïl Averiànitx es posava roig com un gall dindi i, tremolant de dalt a baix, cridava:</p>
<p>«Calla! No discuteixis!»</p>
<p>I al carruatge parlava sense parar ni un moment, descrivint les seves campanyes al Caucas i a Polònia. Quines aventures havia tingut, quins encontres! Parlava a crits i obria tant els ulls d&rsquo;admiració que hom podia pensar que mentia. A més, mentre parlava, li bufava l&rsquo;alè a la cara d&rsquo;Andrei Iefímitx i li rieia a l&rsquo;orella. Això molestava el doctor i li impedia pensar o concentrar-se.</p>
<p>Al tren van viatjar, per qüestions d&rsquo;economia, en tercera classe en un compartiment de no fumadors. La meitat dels passatgers eren gent decent. Mikhaïl Averiànitx aviat va fer amistat amb tothom i, passant d&rsquo;un seient a l&rsquo;altre, no parava de dir a veu en crit que no s&rsquo;havia de viatjar per aquelles línies espantoses. Era un robatori descarrat! Molt diferent anava a cavall: hom podia fer més de setanta milles al dia i sentir-se fresc i sa després. I les nostres males collites es devien al dessecament dels pantans de Pinsk; en conjunt, la manera com es feien les coses era horrorosa. S&rsquo;excitava, parlava a crits i no deixava parlar els altres. Aquesta xerrameca interminable acompanyada de riallades sonores i gestos expressius cansava Andrei Iefímitx.</p>
<p>«Qui de nosaltres dos és el boig?», va pensar amb irritació. «Jo, que procuro no molestar els meus companys de viatge de cap manera, o aquest egoista que es creu més intel·ligent i interessant que ningú i per això no deixa ningú en pau?»</p>
<p>A Moscou, Mikhaïl Averiànitx es va posar una casaca militar sense galons i uns pantalons amb galons vermells. Portava gorra militar i capot al carrer, i els soldats el saludaven. Ara li semblava a Andrei Iefímitx que el seu company era un home que havia llençat tot el que tenia de bo i s&rsquo;havia quedat només amb el dolent de totes les característiques d&rsquo;un terratinent de províncies que havia posseït un temps. Li agradava que el servessin fins quan era del tot innecessari. Tenia els llumins davant seu, a la taula, i els veia, però cridava el cambrer perquè li portés els llumins; no dubtava a aparèixer davant d&rsquo;una criada només amb la roba interior; tractava de tu tots els lacais indistintament, fins i tot els vells, i quan s&rsquo;enfadava els deia imbècils i idiotes. Això, pensava Andrei Iefímitx, era propi d&rsquo;un gentilhome, però repugnant.</p>
<p>Primer de tot, Mikhaïl Averiànitx va dur el seu amic a la Mare de Déu d&rsquo;Iversk. Va pregar amb fervor, vessant llàgrimes i prosternant-se fins a terra, i quan va acabar, va suspirar pregonament i va dir:</p>
<p>«Encara que hom no hi cregui, resar una mica li fa sentir-se millor d&rsquo;alguna manera. Besa la icona, amic meu.»</p>
<p>Andrei Iefímitx se sentia violentat i va besar la imatge, mentre Mikhaïl Averiànitx arrufava els llavis i resava en un murmuri, i de nou se li van omplir els ulls de llàgrimes. Després van anar al Kremlin i van contemplar el Canó del Tsar i la Campana del Tsar, i fins i tot els van tocar amb els dits, van admirar la vista sobre el riu, van visitar el Salvador i el museu Rumiàntsev.</p>
<p>Van dinar a casa Tiéstov. Mikhaïl Averiànitx va contemplar llargament el menú, acariciant-se els bigotis, i va dir amb el to d&rsquo;un gurmet acostumat a dinar en restaurants:</p>
<p>«A veure què ens doneu a menjar avui, àngel!»</p>
<h2>XIV</h2>
<p>El doctor passejava, mirava les coses, menjava i bevia, però tot el temps sentia una sola cosa: irritació contra Mikhaïl Averiànitx. Tenia una gana immensa de descansar del seu amic, d&rsquo;allunyar-se&rsquo;n, d&rsquo;amagar-se, mentre que l&rsquo;amic considerava que era el seu deure no deixar que el doctor fes ni un pas sense ell, i procurar-li tantes distraccions com fos possible. Quan no hi havia res per mirar, l&rsquo;entretenia amb conversa. Andrei Efímitx ho va aguantar dos dies, però el tercer va anunciar al seu amic que estava malalt i volia quedar-se a casa tot el dia; l&rsquo;amic va respondre que en aquest cas també es quedaria ell —que realment necessitava descansar, perquè ja estava esgotat. Andrei Efímitx es va ajeure al sofà, girat cap a l&rsquo;esquena, i amb les dents serrades escoltava el seu amic, que li assegurava amb vehemència que tard o d&rsquo;hora França sens dubte venceria Alemanya, que a Moscou hi havia moltíssims bergants, i que era impossible jutjar la qualitat d&rsquo;un cavall per l&rsquo;aparença exterior. El doctor va començar a sentir un brunzit a les orelles i palpitacions al cor, però per delicadesa no es podia decidir a suplicar al seu amic que se n&rsquo;anés o que callés. Per sort, Mikhaïl Averiànitx es va cansar d&rsquo;estar assegut a l&rsquo;habitació de l&rsquo;hotel, i després de dinar va sortir a passejar.</p>
<p>Tan bon punt es va quedar sol, Andrei Iefímitx es va lliurar a una sensació d&rsquo;alleujament. Que agradable era jeure immòbil al sofà i saber que està sol a l&rsquo;habitació! La vertadera felicitat és impossible sense la solitud. L&rsquo;àngel caigut va trair Déu probablement perquè enyorava la solitud, que els àngels desconeixen. Andrei Iefímitx volia pensar en el que havia vist i escoltat durant els últims dies, però no aconseguia treure&rsquo;s Mikhaïl Averiànytx del cap.</p>
<p>«S&rsquo;ha agafat unes vacances i ha vingut amb mi per amistat, per generositat», pensava el metge amb irritació; «res no podria ser pitjor que aquesta supervisió amistosa. Suposo que és bonegós i generós i un home vivat, però és un avorrit. Un avorrit insuportable. De la mateixa manera, hi ha gent que no diu mai res que no sigui intel·ligent i bo, i, tanmateix, un sent que són persones ximples.»</p>
<p>Els dies següents, Andrei Iefímitx es va declarar malalt i no va voler sortir de l&rsquo;habitació de l&rsquo;hotel; jeia amb la cara cap al respatller del sofà, i patia una agonia de tedi quan el seu amic l&rsquo;entretenia amb conversa, o descansava quan el seu amic no hi era. Estava irritat amb ell mateix per haver vingut, i amb el seu amic, que cada dia es tornava més xerraire i més descurat; no aconseguia elevar els seus pensaments a un nivell seriós i elevat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Això és el que m&rsquo;ha donat la vida real de la qual parlava Ivan Dmítritch», va pensar, fastiguejat per la seva mesquinesa. «Tot i així, no té importància&hellip; Tornaré a casa, i tot continuarà com abans&hellip;»</p>
<p>A Sant Petersburg li va passar el mateix; dies enters no va sortir de l&rsquo;habitació de l&rsquo;hotel, sinó que jeia al sofà i només es llevava per beure cervesa.</p>
<p>Mikhaïl Averianítx tenia una pressa terrible d&rsquo;arribar a Varsòvia.</p>
<p>—Home, per què hauria d&rsquo;anar-hi? —digué Andrei Efímitx amb veu supplicant—. Vés-hi tu sol i deixa&rsquo;m tornar a casa! T&rsquo;ho suplico!</p>
<p>—De cap manera —protestà Mikhaïl Averianítx—. És una ciutat meravellosa.</p>
<p>Andrei Efímitx no tenia prou força de voluntat per imposar la seva opinió, i molt contra la seva inclinació va anar a Varsòvia. Allà no va sortir de l&rsquo;habitació de l&rsquo;hotel, sinó que es va quedar estirat al sofà, furiós amb si mateix, amb l&rsquo;amic i amb els cambrers, que s&rsquo;obstinaven a no entendre el rus; mentre que Mikhaïl Averianítx, sa, vigorós i animat com sempre, es passejava per la ciutat del matí a la nit cercant antics coneguts. Diverses vegades no va tornar a casa de nit. Després d&rsquo;una nit passada en algun lloc desconegut, va tornar a casa ben de matí, en un estat d&rsquo;excitació violenta, amb la cara vermella i els cabells esbojarrats. Durant molta estona va anar amunt i avall per les habitacions murmurjant alguna cosa per a si mateix, després es va aturar i va dir:</p>
<p>{}
    &ldquo;traduccio&rdquo;: &ldquo;—Honor per damunt de tot.\n\nDesprés de caminar amunt i avall una estona més, s&rsquo;agafà el cap amb les dues mans i digué amb veu tràgica: \n—Sí, honor per damunt de tot! Maleït sigui el moment que se&rsquo;m va ocórrer visitar aquesta Babilònia! Estimat amic meu —afegí, adreçant-se al doctor—, podeu menysprear-me, he jugat i he perdut; presteu-me cinc-cents rubles!\n\nAndrei Iefimitx comptà cinc-cents rubles i els donà al seu amic sense dir paraula. Aquest, encara vermell de vergonya i còlera, balbucejar alguna maledicció inútil, es posà la gorra i marxà. Quan tornà dues hores més tard es deixà caure en una butaca, suspirà sorollosament i digué: \n—El meu honor està salvat. Anem-hi, amic meu; no vull quedar-me ni una hora més en aquesta ciutat maleïda. Bergants! Espies austríacs!&rdquo;,

<p>Quan els amics van tornar a casa seva ja era novembre, i un mantell de neu espessa cobria els carrers. El doctor Hobotov havia ocupat el lloc d&rsquo;Andrei Iefímitx; encara vivia al seu antic habitatge, esperant que Andrei Iefímitx arribés i desallotgés les dependències hospitalàries. La dona vulgar que ell anomenava la seva cuinera ja s&rsquo;havia instal·lat en un dels pavellons.</p>
<p>Corrien pel poble nous escàndols sobre l&rsquo;hospital. Es deia que la dona vulgar havia discutit amb l&rsquo;administrador, i que aquest s&rsquo;havia arrossegat de genolls davant seu demanant perdó. El mateix primer dia que va arribar, Andrei Iefímitx va haver de buscar allotjament.</p>
<p>—Amic meu —li va dir tímidament l&rsquo;administrador de correus—, disculpeu una pregunta indiscreta: de quins recursos disposeu?</p>
<p>Andrei Iefímitx, sense dir paraula, va comptar els diners i va dir:
—Vuitanta-sis rubles.</p>
<p>—No em referia a això —va dir Mikhaïl Averiànitx, confús, sense entendre&rsquo;l—; vull dir, de què vius?</p>
<p>—Ja t&rsquo;ho dic, vuitanta-sis rubles&hellip; No tinc res més.</p>
<p>Mikhaïl Averiànitx considerava el doctor un home honrat, però sospitava que havia acumulat una fortuna d&rsquo;almenys vint mil rubles. Ara que s&rsquo;assabentava que Andrei Iefímitx era un indigent, que no tenia de què viure, se li van omplir els ulls de llàgrimes, no sabia per què, i va abraçar l&rsquo;amic.</p>
<h2>XV</h2>
<p>Andrei Iefímitx vivia ara en una caseta de tres finestres. A més de la cuina, la caseta només tenia tres habitacions. El doctor n&rsquo;ocupava dues que donaven al carrer, mentre que Dariúixka i la propietària amb els seus tres fills vivien a la tercera habitació i la cuina. De vegades l&rsquo;amant de la propietària, un pagès borratxo i pendencier que aterrorisava els nens i la Dariúixka, venia a passar la nit. Quan arribava i s&rsquo;instal·lava a la cuina exigint vodka, tots se sentien molt incòmodes, i el doctor, mogut per compassió, es portava els nens que ploraven a la seva habitació i els deixava dormir a terra, cosa que li donava gran satisfacció.</p>
<p>{
    &ldquo;traduccio&rdquo;: &ldquo;Es llevava com sempre a les vuit, i després del te matinal s&rsquo;asseia a llegir els seus llibres i revistes vells: no tenia diners per comprar-ne de nous. Potser perquè els llibres eren vells, o potser pel canvi d&rsquo;ambient, llegir l&rsquo;esgotava i ja no li captava l&rsquo;atenció com abans. Per ocupar el temps, va fer un catàleg detallat dels seus llibres i hi va enganxar petites etiquetes al llom. Aquesta tasca mecànica i feixuga li resultava més interessant que llegir. El treball monòton i pesat li aquietava la ment sense saber com, i el temps passava de pressa mentre no pensava en res. Fins i tot estar assegut a la cuina, pelant patates amb la Dariuixka o netejant el blat sarraí, li semblava interessant. Els dissabtes i diumenges anava a l&rsquo;església. Dret prop de la paret i amb els ulls mig clucs, escoltava els cants i pensava en el seu pare, en la seva mare, en la universitat, en les religions del món. Se sentia tranquil i melancòlic, i quan sortia de l&rsquo;església lamentava que l&rsquo;ofici hagués acabat tan aviat. Va anar dues vegades a l&rsquo;hospital per parlar amb l&rsquo;Ivan Dmítrittx. Però en totes dues ocasions l&rsquo;Ivan Dmítrittx estava inusualment excitat i malhumorat. Li va demanar al doctor que el deixés en pau, ja que feia temps que estava fart de xerrameca buida, i va declarar que, per compensar tots els seus sofriments, només demanava una cosa als maleïts canelles: l&rsquo;aïllament. Segur que no li negarien ni això? En totes dues ocasions, quan l&rsquo;Andrei Ief&rdquo;,

<p>—Vés-te&rsquo;n a fer punyetes!</p>
<p>I Andrei Iefímitx no sabia ara si havia d&rsquo;anar-hi per tercera vegada o no. Se li&rsquo;n morien les ganes d&rsquo;anar-hi.</p>
<p>En altres temps Andrei Iefímitx solia passejar per les habitacions i pensar durant l&rsquo;interval després de dinar, però ara des de l&rsquo;hora de dinar fins al te de la tarda es quedava estirat al sofà amb la cara girada cap al respatller i s&rsquo;abandonava a pensaments trivials contra els quals no podia lluitar. L&rsquo;humiliava que després de més de vint anys de servei no li haguessin donat ni pensió ni cap ajuda. És cert que no havia fet la seva feina honestament, però, per altra banda, tots els que són al Servei reben una pensió sense distinció, siguin honests o no. La justícia contemporània rau precisament en la concessió de graus, condecoracions i pensions, no per qualitats morals o capacitats, sinó pel servei, sigui com sigui que hagi estat. Per què havia de ser ell l&rsquo;única excepció? No tenia diners de cap mena. Li feia vergonya passar per davant de la botiga i mirar la dona que la regentava. Ja devia trenta-dos rubles de cervesa. També devia diners a la patrona. Dariuixka venia roba vella i llibres a amagat, i mentia a la patrona dient que el doctor estava a punt de rebre una gran suma de diners.</p>

    &ldquo;traduccio&rdquo;: &ldquo;S&rsquo;enfadava amb ell mateix per haver malbaratat en viatges els mil rubles que havia estalviat. Quanta falta li farien ara aquells diners! Li molestava que la gent no el deixés tranquil. Hobotov es creia obligat a visitar de tant en tant el seu col·lega malalt. Tot el que feia d&rsquo;aquell home li resultava repugnant a Andrei Iefímitx: la cara rollissa, el to vulgar i condescendent, la manera com deia «col·lega», les botes altes. Però el més repugnant de tot era que es creia amb el dret de tractar-lo, convençut que realment l&rsquo;estava curant. A cada visita li portava una ampolla de bromur i pastilles de ruibarbre.\n\nMikhaïl Averiànitx també es creia obligat a visitar el seu amic i fer-li companyia. Cada cop que entrava a veure Andrei Iefímitx, feia veure que estava tranquil, reia forçadament i li assegurava que avui tenia molt bon aspecte, que gràcies a Déu s&rsquo;estava recuperant. D&rsquo;això es podia deduir que considerava l&rsquo;estat del seu amic sense esperança. Encara no havia pagat el deute de Varsòvia i la vergonya el consumia. Es trobava incòmode, i per això procurava riure més fort i ser més enginyós. Les anècdotes i descripcions se li feien eternes, i resultaven un turment tant per a Andrei Iefímitx com per a ell mateix.&rdquo;.</p>

<p>En presència seva, Andrei Iefímitx solia jeure al sofà mirant cap a la paret i escoltava amb les dents clencades; l&rsquo;ànima se li oprimia d&rsquo;un fàstic corroent, i després de cada visita del seu amic sentia com si aquest fàstic hagués pujat més amunt i li pugés cap a la gola.</p>
<p>Per ofegar els pensaments mesquins es posava ràpidament a reflexionar que ell mateix, i Khobótov, i Mikhaïl Averiànitx, tots perecerien tard o d&rsquo;hora sense deixar cap rastre al món. Si hom s&rsquo;imaginava algun esperit volant sobre la Terra a l&rsquo;espai d&rsquo;aquí a un milió d&rsquo;anys, no hi veuria res més que argila i roques pelades. Tot —la cultura i la llei moral— passaria i ni una bardana no hi sortiria. Quina importància tenia la vergonya davant d&rsquo;un botiguer, quina importància tenia l&rsquo;insignificant Khobótov o l&rsquo;avorridora amistat de Mikhaïl Averiànitx? Tot era trivial i absurd.</p>
<p>Però aquestes reflexions no l&rsquo;ajudaven ara. Amb prou feines havia imaginat el globus terrestre d&rsquo;aquí a un milió d&rsquo;anys, quan Hobotov amb les seves botes altes o Mikhail Averianitch amb la seva rialla forçada apareixien darrere d&rsquo;una roca nua, i fins i tot sentia el xiuxiueig avergonyit: «El deute de Varsòvia&hellip; Te&rsquo;l tornaré en un dia o dos, amic meu, sense falta&hellip;»</p>
<h2>XVI</h2>
<p>Un dia Mikhail Averianitch va venir després de dinar quan Andrei Iefímitx jeia al sofà. Es va donar la casualitat que Hobotov va arribar al mateix temps amb el seu bromur. Andrei Iefímitx es va aixecar pesadament i es va asseure, recolzant els dos braços al sofà.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Avui tens molt millor color que ahir, amic meu», va començar Mikhail Averianitch. «Sí, tens bon aspecte. De debò que sí!»</p>
<p>«Ja és hora que et recuperis del tot, estimat col·lega», va dir Khobotov, bostegant. «Segur que ja tens prou d&rsquo;aquest malson.»</p>
<p>«I ens recuperarem», va dir Mikhaïl Averiànitx amb bon humor. «Viurem cent anys més! És clar que sí!»</p>
<p>«No cent anys, però sí uns altres vint», va dir Khobotov per tranquil·litzar-lo. «Tot anirà bé, tot anirà bé, col·lega; no perdis l&rsquo;ànim&hellip; No t&rsquo;ho prenguis tan malament!»</p>
<p>«Ja veuran el que som capaços de fer», va riure Mikhaïl Averiànitx, i va donar una palmada al genoll del seu amic. «Ja els ensenyarem! L&rsquo;estiu que ve, si Déu vol, ens en anirem al Caucas i ens ho recorrerem tot a cavall: al trot, al trot, al trot! I quan tornem del Caucas no m&rsquo;estranyaria gens que balléssim tots al casament.» Mikhaïl Averiànitx va fer una ulladeta maliciosa. «Et casarem, xicot, et casarem&hellip;»</p>
<p>Andrei Iefímitx va sentir de sobte que l&rsquo;enuig se li pujava a la gola, el cor se li va posar a bategar violentament.</p>
<p>—Això és vulgar —va dir, aixecant-se de pressa i anant cap a la finestra—. No entens que estàs dient vulgaritats sense sentit?</p>
<p>Tenia la intenció de continuar amb suavitat i cortesia, però contra la seva voluntat, de sobte va tancar els punys i se&rsquo;ls va aixecar per damunt del cap.</p>
<p>—Deixeu-me en pau! —va cridar amb una veu que no semblava la seva, enrogint i tremolant de dalt a baix—. Marxeu, els dos!</p>
<p>Mikhaïl Averiànitx i Khobótov es van aixecar i el van mirar sorpresos primer, alarmats després.</p>
<p>—Marxeu, els dos! —va continuar cridant Andrei Iefímitx—. Estúpids! Imbècils! No vull ni la vostra amistat ni les vostres medicines, estúpid! Vulgar! Fastigós!</p>
<p>Hobotov i Mikhàil Averianítx es van mirar desconcertats, van trontollar fins a la porta i van sortir. Andrei Iefimítx va agafar l&rsquo;ampolla de bromur i la va llançar darrere d&rsquo;ells; l&rsquo;ampolla es va estavellar contra el marc de la porta.</p>
<p>—Aneu-vos-en al dimoni! —va cridar amb veu planyívola, corrent cap al passadís—. Al dimoni!</p>
<p>Quan els convidats van marxar, Andrei Iefimítx es va estirar al sofà, tremolant com si tingués febre, i va continuar repetint durant una bona estona: «Gent estúpida! Gent necia!»</p>
<p>Quan es va calmar, el primer que li va venir al cap va ser pensar que el pobre Mikhàil Averianítx devia sentir-se terriblement avergonyit i abatut ara, i que tot plegat era horrible. Mai no li havia passat res semblant. On era la seva intel·ligència i el seu tacte? On era la seva comprensió de les coses i la seva indiferència filosòfica?</p>

Allà tindreu menjar sa i assistència i tractament. Encara que, entre nosaltres, Ievgueni Fiòdorovitx és <em>mauvais ton</em>; tanmateix, entén la seva feina, us hi podeu refiar completament. M&rsquo;ha promès que us cuidarà.</p>
<p>Andrei Efímitx es va commoure per la simpatia sincera del mestre de correus i les llàgrimes que de sobte li van brillar a les galtes.</p>
<p>—Amic meu estimat, no us ho creieu! —va xiuxiuejar, posant-se la mà al cor—; no us ho creieu. Tot plegat és una farsa. La meva malaltia és només que en vint anys només he trobat un home intel·ligent a tota la ciutat, i està boig. Jo no estic gens malalt, és simplement que he caigut dins un cercle encantat del qual no se&rsquo;n pot sortir. M&rsquo;és igual; estic preparat per a qualsevol cosa.</p>
<p>—Aneu a l&rsquo;hospital, amic meu.</p>
<p>—M&rsquo;és igual que sigui a l&rsquo;infern.</p>
<p>—Doneu-me la vostra paraula, estimat amic, que obeïreu Ievgueni Fiòdoritx en tot.</p>
<p>—És clar que us dono la meva paraula. Però us repeteixo, amic meu estimat, he caigut dins un cercle encantat. Ara tot, fins i tot la simpatia sincera dels meus amics, porta a la mateixa cosa: a la meva ruïna. Vaig cap a la meva ruïna, i tinc la dignitat de reconèixer-ho.</p>

<p>Cap al vespre del mateix dia, Hobotov, amb la seva pellissa i les botes altes, va aparèixer de sobte i va dir a Andrei Iefiímitx amb un to com si el dia anterior no hagués passat res: </p>
<p>&lsquo;He vingut per una qüestió professional, col·lega. He vingut a proposar-vos que m&rsquo;ajudeu amb una consulta mèdica. Eh?»</p>
<p>Pensant que Hobotov volia distreure&rsquo;l amb una sortida, o potser per permetre-li realment guanyar alguna cosa, Andrei Iefiímitx es va posar l&rsquo;abric i el barret, i va sortir amb ell al carrer. Es va alegrar de l&rsquo;oportunitat d&rsquo;esmenar el seu error del dia anterior i reconciliar-se, i en el seu cor va agrair a Hobotov, que ni tan sols va al·ludir a l&rsquo;escena d&rsquo;ahir i evidentment el tractava amb tacte. Mai no s&rsquo;hauria esperat tanta delicadesa d&rsquo;aquest home inculte.</p>
<p>{
    &ldquo;traduccio&rdquo;: &ldquo;—On és el malalt? —va preguntar Andrei Iefímitx.\n\n—A l&rsquo;hospital&hellip; Fa temps que us el volia mostrar. Un cas molt interessant.\n\nVan entrar al pati de l&rsquo;hospital i, voltant l&rsquo;edifici principal, es van dirigir cap al pavelló on tenien els malalts mentals, i tot això, per alguna raó, en silenci. Quan van entrar al pavelló, Nikita, com sempre, va fer un salt i es va quadrar.\n\n—Un dels pacients d&rsquo;aquí té una complicació pulmonar —va dir Hobotov en veu baixa, sortint al pati amb Andrei Iefímitx—. Espereu aquí, torno ara mateix. Vaig a buscar un estetoscopi.\n\nI se&rsquo;n va anar.\n\n</p>
<h2>XVII</h2>
<p>Ja s&rsquo;enfosquia. Ivan Dmitritch jeia al llit amb la cara enfonsada al coixí; el paralític estava assegut immòbil, plorant en silenci i movent els llavis. El pagès gras i l&rsquo;antic classificador dormien. Regnava el silenci.</p>
<p>Andrei Iefímitx es va asseure al llit d&rsquo;Ivan Dmitritch i va esperar. Però va passar mitja hora, i en lloc d&rsquo;Hobotov, va entrar a la sala Nikita amb una bata, roba interior i unes sabatilles en un munt al braç.</p>
<p>—Canviï&rsquo;s de roba, excel·lència —va dir suaument—. Aquí té el seu llit; vingui per aquí —va afegir, assenyalant un llit buit que era evident que acabaven de portar a la sala—. Tot anirà bé; Déu vulgui que es recuperi.</p>
<p>Andrei Iefímitx ho va entendre tot. Sense dir res, va anar cap al llit que Nikita li assenyalava i s&rsquo;hi va asseure; veient que Nikita es quedava esperant, es va despullar completament i va sentir vergonya. Després es va posar la roba de l&rsquo;hospital; els calçotets eren molt curts, la camisa llarga, i la bata feia olor de peix fumat.</p>
<p>—Déu vulgui que es recuperi —va repetir Nikita, i va recollir la roba d&rsquo;Andrei Iefímitx entre els braços, va sortir i va tancar la porta.</p>
<p>—No importa&hellip; —va pensar Andrei Iefímitx, embolicant-se a la bata amb vergonya i sentint que amb aquell vestit nou semblava un presoner—. No importa&hellip; Tant se val que sigui frac, uniforme o aquesta bata.</p>
<p>Però què havia passat amb el rellotge? I el carnet que duia a la butxaca lateral? I els cigarrets? On s&rsquo;havia endut Nikita la seva roba? Potser fins al dia de la seva mort no tornaria a portar pantalons, armilla i botes altes. Tot plegat era estrany i fins i tot incomprensible al principi. Andrei Iefímitx encara estava convençut que no hi havia diferència entre la casa de la seva patrona i la Sala número 6, que tot en aquest món era disbarat i vanitat de vanitats. I tanmateix li tremolaven les mans, tenia els peus freds, i l&rsquo;omplia d&rsquo;horror el pensament que aviat Ivan Dmitritch es despertaria i el veuria amb bata. Es va aixecar i va caminar per l&rsquo;habitació i va tornar a asseure&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Portava assegut ja mitja hora, una hora, i se&rsquo;n sentia miserablement fart: era realment possible viure aquí un dia, una setmana, i fins i tot anys com aquesta gent? Doncs s&rsquo;havia assegut aquí, havia caminat amunt i avall i havia tornat a asseure&rsquo;s; podia aixecar-se i mirar per la finestra i caminar d&rsquo;un racó a l&rsquo;altre una altra vegada, i després què? Estar-se assegut així tot el temps, com un pal, i pensar? No, això era gairebé impossible.</p>
<p>Andrei Iefímitx es va estirar, però immediatament es va aixecar, es va eixugar la suor freda del front amb la màniga i va sentir que tota la cara li feia olor de peix fumat. Va tornar a caminar.</p>
<p>—És un malentès&hellip; —va dir, obrint les palmes de les mans amb perplexitat—. S&rsquo;ha d&rsquo;aclarir. És un malentès.</p>
<p>Mentrestant Ivan Dmitritch es va despertar; es va incorporar i es va recolzar les galtes amb els punys. Va escopir. Després va mirar peresosament el metge, i aparentment durant el primer moment no va entendre res; però aviat la seva cara endormiscada es va tornar maliciosa i burleta.</p>
<p>—Aha! Així que també l&rsquo;han ficat aquí, company! —va dir amb una veu ronca pel son, parpellejant amb un ull—. Em fa molt content veure&rsquo;l. Vostè va xuclar la sang dels altres, i ara li xuclaran la seva. Excel·lent!</p>
<p>—És un malentès&hellip; —va proferir Andrei Iefímitx, espantat per les paraules d&rsquo;Ivan Dmitritch; va encongir les espatlles i va repetir—: És algun malentès.</p>
<p>Ivan Dmitritch va tornar a escopir i es va estirar.</p>
<p>—Vida maleïda —va rondinar—, i el que és amarg i insultant és que aquesta vida no acabarà amb cap compensació pels nostres sofriments, no acabarà amb cap apoteosi com en una òpera, sinó amb la mort; vindran pagesos i arrossegaran el nostre cos mort pels braços i les cames fins al soterrani. Ecs! Bé, no importa&hellip; Ens ho passarem bé en l&rsquo;altre món&hellip; Vindré aquí com un fantasma de l&rsquo;altre món i espantaré aquests rèptils. Els faré emblanquir els cabells.</p>
<p>Moiseika va tornar, i en veure el metge, li va estendre la mà.</p>
<p>—Doni&rsquo;m un copequet —va dir.</p>
<h2>XVIII</h2>
<p>Andrei Iefímitx es va dirigir cap a la finestra i va mirar cap a la campinya. S&rsquo;estava fent fosc, i a l&rsquo;horitzó, cap al costat dret, s&rsquo;alçava una lluna freda i carmesí. No gaire lluny de la tanca de l&rsquo;hospital, a poc més de dos-cents metres, s&rsquo;alçava una casa alta i blanca tancada per un mur de pedra. Aquella era la presó.</p>
<p>«Doncs això és la vida real», va pensar Andrei Iefímitx, i va sentir por.</p>
<p>La lluna i la presó, i els claus de la tanca, i les flames llunyanes de la fàbrica de cremar ossos, tot era terrible. Al darrere seu se sentí un sospir. Andrei Iefímitx es va girar i va veure un home amb estrelles i condecoracions brillants al pit, que somreia i feia l&rsquo;ullet amb astúcia. I això també li va semblar terrible.</p>

La reixa sòlida no va cedir.\n\nLlavors, perquè no fos tan terrible, va anar al llit d'Ivan Dmítrikh i s'hi va asseure.\n\n—M'he desanimat, estimat amic —va murmurar, tremolant i eixugant-se la suor freda—, m'he perdut l'ànim.\n\n—Hauríeu de ser filosòfic —va dir Ivan Dmítrikh amb ironia.\n\n—Déu meu, Déu meu... Sí, sí... Vau dir un cop que a Rússia no hi havia filosofia, però que tothom, fins els més mesquins, parla de filosofia.

<p>—Dius ximpleries. Si no t&rsquo;agrada ser metge, hauries d&rsquo;haver-te dedicat a la política.</p>
<p>—No podia, no podia fer res. Som febles, amic meu&hellip; Jo abans era indiferent.

<p>Andrei Iefímitx, mentre s&rsquo;acostava el vespre, se sentia turmentat per una altra sensació persistent, a més del terror i del ressentiment. Finalment, es va adonar que tenia ganes de fumar i de beure cervesa.</p>

<p>—Per descomptat que és tirania —va dir Andrei Iefímitx, encoratjat per l&rsquo;explosió d&rsquo;Ivan Dmítritx—. He de sortir, vull sortir. No té cap dret! Obre, t&rsquo;ho dic!</p>
<p>—Sents, brut imbècil? —va cridar Ivan Dmítritx, i va colpejar la porta amb el puny—. Obre la porta, o la faré malbé! Botxí!</p>
<p>—Obre la porta —va cridar Andrei Iefímitx, tremolant de cap a peus—; ho exigeixo!</p>
<p>—Parleu tant com vulgueu! —va respondre Nikita des de l&rsquo;altra banda de la porta—. Parleu tant com vulgueu&hellip;</p>
<p>—Almenys, vés a cridar Ievgueni Fiòdoritx! Digue-li que li demano que vingui un minut!</p>
<p>—Sa senyoria vindrà sol demà.</p>
<p>—Mai ens deixaran sortir —continuava mentrestant Ivan Dmítritx—. Ens deixaran podrir aquí! Oh, Senyor, pot ser que no hi hagi infern en l&rsquo;altre món i aquests malvats siguin perdonats? On és la justícia? Obre la porta, miserable! M&rsquo;ofego! —va cridar amb veu ronca, i es va llançar contra la porta—. Em trencaré el cap, assassins!</p>
<p>Nikita va obrir la porta de cop i amb les dues mans i el genoll va empènyer amb força Andreu Iefímitx cap enrere, després va alçar el braç i li va donar un cop de puny a la cara. A Andreu Iefímitx li va semblar que una onada salada gegantina l&rsquo;embolicava del cap als peus i se l&rsquo;endugués cap al llit; realment sentia un gust de sal a la boca: segurament li rajava sang de les dents. Va agitar els braços com si intentés nedar per sortir-ne i es va agafar al capçal del llit, i en el mateix moment va sentir com Nikita li pegava dos cops més a l&rsquo;esquena.</p>
<p>Ivan Dmítritch va llançar un crit estrident. També l&rsquo;havien hagut de colpejar.</p>
<p>Llavors tot va quedar quiet, la llum tènue de la lluna es filtrà per la reixeta i una ombra com una xarxa es va estendre pel terra. Era terrible. Andreu Iefímitx va quedar ajagut contenint la respiració: esperava amb horror que li tornessin a pegar. Sentia com si algú li hagués ficat una falç dintre, l&rsquo;hi hagués girada diverses vegades al pit i als budells. Es va mossegar el coixí de dolor i va serrar les dents, i de sobte, enmig del caos que tenia al cervell, li va passar per la ment el pensament terrible i insuportable que aquella gent, que ara semblaven ombres negres a la llum de la lluna, havia d&rsquo;aguantar aquest dolor dia rere dia, any rere any. Com podia haver passat que durant més de vint anys no ho havia sabut i s&rsquo;havia negat a saber-ho? No sabia res del dolor, no en tenia cap concepte, de manera que no en tenia la culpa, però la consciència, tan inexorable i tan rude com Nikita, el va fer refredre del capdamunt del cap als talons. Va saltar dret, va intentar cridar amb totes les forces i córrer a matar Nikita, i després Hobótov, el superintendent i l&rsquo;ajudant, i després ell mateix; però no li va sortir cap so del pit, i les cames no li obeïen. Sense alè, es va estripar la bata i la camisa del pit, se les va esquinçar, i va caure sense sentits al llit.</p>
<h2>XIX</h2>
<p>L&rsquo;endemà al matí li feia mal el cap, sentia un brunzit a les orelles i una gran feblesa per tot el cos. No es va avergonyir de recordar la seva debilitat del dia anterior. Havia estat covard. Fins i tot havia tingut por de la lluna. Havia expressat obertament pensaments i sentiments que no s&rsquo;esperava tenir. Per exemple, la idea que aquella gent mesquina que filosofava estava realment descontenta. Però ara ja no li importava res.</p>
<p>No va menjar res. No va beure res. Es va quedar estirat, immòbil i callat.</p>
<p>«Tot m&rsquo;és igual», pensava quan li feien preguntes. «No respondré&hellip; Tot m&rsquo;és igual».</p>
<p>Després de dinar, Mikhaïl Averíanytx li va portar un quart de lliura de te i una lliura de pastilles de fruita. També va venir Dariúixka i es va quedar una hora sencera al costat del llit amb una expressió de pena sorda a la cara. El doctor Khobótov el va visitar. Va portar una ampolla de bromur i va dir a Nikita que fumigués la sala.</p>

<p>«home amb estrelles i condecoracions brillants al pit»</p>
</blockquote>
<p>El sistema de condecoracions i ordres de l&rsquo;Imperi Rus era complex i omnipresent. Les &ldquo;estrelles&rdquo; es refereixen probablement a les insígnies de les ordres imperials, que indicaven rang social i proximitat al poder.</p>

                <p>Ivan Dmitrikh fa referència al debat intel·lectual del s. XIX sobre l&rsquo;originalitat del pensament rus. Molts intel·lectuals russos se sentien complexats davant la filosofia europea occidental, especialment l&rsquo;alemanya.</p>
